\chapter{Discussion}\label{chapter:discussion}

The systems in this thesis give teachers more awareness about the content generated by students in large programming classes and enable styles of teaching that are usually only feasible in smaller classes, such as discussions of variation and style that are directly driven by what the students have already written. These systems also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend scale up automated compare-contrast, self-explanation, and formative assessment-style exercises whose content is generated by students and curated by teachers. The current state of the art in theories of how humans learn predict that these supported interactions between teachers and students will enhance learning.

\DIFdelend \section{Design Decisions and Choices}

%As the complexity of code increases, students face more design decisions.

This thesis work began with the vision that a teacher would someday be able to look at a display summarizing hundreds or thousands of student solutions to the same problem and immediately see---and comment on---good and bad design decisions that students made. The number of possible distinct student solutions grows rapidly with the number of design decisions and design choices students can make. 

The solution space could be imagined as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a large n-dimensional spacewhere each solution has a single coordinate. Each }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an $n$-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a }\DIFaddend design decision, e.g., whether to solve a problem iteratively or recursively\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, would be a dimension in the solution space. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The design }\DIFaddend choices students make could be thought of as discrete points along \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that dimension in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{each dimension in that }\DIFaddend solution space. While the number of distinct combinations of design choices students choose can be large, the number of dimensions in this space, i.e., the underlying design decisions, grows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{much }\DIFdelend more slowly. 

However, the structure of this hypothetical solution space ignores how design choices affect each other. Some design decisions are mutually exclusive, e.g., looping over a particular array with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a for or a while}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{for}} \DIFadd{or }\texttt{\DIFadd{while}}\DIFaddend , some decisions are correlated with one another, and some decisions are completely independent. A tree-like description of the solution space can capture some of these relationships between decisions. If a node represents a design choice, e.g., to loop over an array, there may be two or more choices, e.g., a \texttt{for} or a \texttt{while} loop, that can be represented as child nodes. The choice to use a \texttt{for} loop poses an additional design design, e.g., whether to use \texttt{range} or \texttt{xrange}: \texttt{for i in [x]range(input)}. The average depth of the tree would correspond to the average number of design decisions the students faced and the average branching factor would correspond to the average number of distinct choices students in the corpus make at each decision point.

The curse of dimensionality predicts that, as we add more and more dimensions to the solution space, the density of solutions will decrease and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{liklihood }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{likelihood }\DIFaddend that any two solutions occupy the same location in that space will go down. The regularity of code discussed in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the chapter on related work }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Related Work }\DIFaddend should help ameliorate the curse of dimensionality, but only partly. In other domains, it is often necessary to collect more data as the dimensionality of the space increases. However, given that the solutions are generated by students, the number of correct solutions are more likely to go down rather than up as the complexity of solutions, and the associated dimensionality of the solution space, increases.

This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{difficulties posed by high-dimensional spaces have been addressed, in each problem tackled, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{vision of the solution space inspired and is shaped by the concrete systems built and described in this thesis. In each system, the dimensions of solution variety have been tamed and orderd }\DIFaddend by choosing what \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{information }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{features }\DIFaddend to ignore and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, in some cases, what information }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{what features }\DIFaddend to index by. For example, OverCode ignores white space, comments, variable names, and statement orders. It indexes by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend lines. In order to assign a variable name quiz, Foobaz looks at the behavior of the variables in the student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend solution, ignoring everything else about \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the solution's composition. ClassOverflow }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it. Dear Beta }\DIFaddend and GroverCode forget what values cause a solution to fail a test case, preserving only that the test case has failed. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The optimization hint-collecting workflow within ClassOverflow }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Dear Gamma }\DIFaddend ignores circuit topology and indexes by the number of transistors.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It is important to note that this work is not intended to capture an enumeration of all possible design choices and resulting solutions. It is intended to capture the design choices students are actually making. The relative popularity of these choices is discussed in the section that follows.
}\DIFdelend %DIF > It is important to note that this work is not intended to capture an enumeration of all possible design choices and resulting solutions. It is intended to capture the design choices students are actually making. The relative popularity of these choices is discussed in the section that follows.

\section{Capturing the Underlying Distribution}

There will be some design decisions within each solution that are rare and some that are common, some that exemplify good programming practices and others that do not. These decisions might create inefficient solutions, reveal a student's fundamental misunderstanding, or use a feature of the language in a creative way. The distribution of solutions along these dimensions of variation may reflect student prior knowledge, teacher explanations, and common misconceptions. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{During Hannah Wallach's invited talk at the interpretable machine learning workshop at ICML 2016, she made the following observation: computer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Computer }\DIFaddend scientists are often looking for better ways to find needles in haystacks and computationally-minded social scientists are trying to characterize the haystack\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{wallachHaystack}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . One could think of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{work like }\DIFdelend Codex~\cite{codex} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as a mechanism for finding needles, i.e., particular code fragments, in haystacks, i.e., large collections of open source code. One could also think of }\DIFaddend Webzeitgeist~\cite{webzeitgeist} as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mechanisms }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a mechanism }\DIFaddend for finding needles\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in haystacks through creative indexing of Ruby code and webpages, respectively.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, i.e., web design choices, in haystacks, i.e., large collections of web pages. }\DIFaddend OverCode, Foobaz, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and ClassOverflow }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Dear Beta, Dear Gamma, and GroverCode }\DIFaddend are trying to faithfully represent the haystack\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{itself, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, i.e., the distribution of student solutions and bugs, }\DIFaddend while also supporting needle-finding.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OverCode characterizes the haystack by identifying and displaying the relative popularity of different correct solutions. It also provides filtering and cluster-merging tools that help teachers find needles, e.g., interesting and unusal solutions. Similarly, GroverCode helps teachers understand the haystack of correct and incorrect solutions by displaying the distribution of solutions as a function of their correctness on test cases.
}

\DIFadd{Foobaz characterizes the haystack of variable naming choices by diplaying the relative popularity of different names in each OverCode stack of solutions and across the entire dataset of solutions. The feature of sorting by popularity allows teachers to see the common names as well as the needles, i.e., uncommon names that might be excellent or terrible. 
}

\DIFadd{The learnersourcing workflows helped students, in addition to teachers, understand the distribution of solutions and bugs. Dear Beta reveals some information about the distribution of failed test cases. The variety of student debugging hints for each failed test case reveals some information about how many different possible problems might cause each failed test case. In Dear Gamma, the optimality of circuit solutions was quantified as the number of transistors. The haystack was characterized by visualizing the distribution of solutions from least to most optimal. This distribution was examined by teachers and given to students after they completed their own solution. The distribution helped teachers identify the most optimal solution, which represented a needle, i.e., a very small proportion of all solutions.
}

\section{Helping Teachers Generate Solution-Driven Content}

\DIFadd{The future generations of tools like OverCode, Foobaz, Dear Beta and Dear Gamma might allow teachers to continuously mine the solutions of their thousands of current and previous students, generating days worth of lessons just by extracting themes from both the innovative and problematic design decisions found in the growing pile of student solutions. This would be an opportunity to discuss and reflect on the various trade-offs that exist in each different solution or optimization. 
}

\DIFadd{Turning teacher actions and annotations into personalized feedback for students need not be restricted to variable names. For example, when a teacher writes a rewrite rule in OverCode, OverCode could treat that as an implicit annotation that one sytactic form is semantically quivalent and stylistically superior to another. Like Foobaz's variable name quizzes, the teacher's implicit or explicit commentary could be sent to current and future students as a personalized quiz or just a helpful suggestion. Ideally, all the work that a teacher does in an interface to make sense of student solutions could be automatically translated into solution-driven discussion content and rich feedback.
}

\DIFadd{These solution-driven lessons and feedback would be reuseable as long as the problem specifications do not change. This aligns well with the lifecycle of many courses that are eventually offered at scale. First, the material is iteratively developed and debugged in residential, face-to-face teaching environments. When the course is stable, it can be put up online for a larger number of remote students to engage with. Finally, the course can be archived in such a way that any new student can move through the material at their own pace, but there is no guarantee of staff or a cohort of fellow students moving through the material synchronously. Tools like OverCode, Foobaz, Dear Beta, and Dear Gamma accumulate solutions, commentary, and hints in such a way that, after enough students and teachers have used them for a given problem, new students can benefit from them without synchronous peers or teachers.
}

\DIFaddend \section{Writing Solutions Well}

The focus on introductory Python programming courses is often just correctness. The MIT EECS introductory Python programming course whose staff used GroverCode makes it a policy not to penalize students on how their solution is written. This means that they sometimes have to hand out full marks to a solution that makes them groan.

This policy may exist for several reasons. The first is the clarity of the policy: if it is correct, it gets full credit. Second is the clarity of the evaluation: if it passes the suite of test cases, it is correct. Third is the apparent appropriateness of the objective for novices: it may be too hard for novices to write a solution well in addition to achieving correctness. % worry about writing well in addition to writing correctly.% bear both the cognitive load of writing a solution well in addition to correctly.

However, it can also be very hard to achieve a correct solution if it is not written well. Something as simple as poor variable names, such as giving an array index a name that suggests it holds the value of the array at that index, can cause students to produce incorrect code.

Just as there is no silver bullet for writing prose well, there is no silver bullet for writing solutions well. Solutions, prose, products, buildings etc., are all designed, and each community has its own ways \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for how }\DIFdelend to help students make good design decisions. For example, in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Steven Pinker's book "}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFaddend The Sense of Style\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{", he suggests and then demonstrates how to pick }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin }\DIFadd{, Steven Pinker suggests picking }\DIFaddend apart examples of good writing to understand what makes them good\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Students of a particular design form may attend }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{pinkersense}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The software industry uses one-on-one peer review, often called code review, to find bugs and judge design decisions. This may also serve as an informal teaching opportunity for software engineers. Some communities create }\DIFaddend design studios, where \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{they discuss each of their work in turn and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend give and receive constructive criticism from peers. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In both these examples of prose and design, the designed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Designed }\DIFaddend objects are examined individually and also as a group, emulating the conditions for learning from variation espoused by the theories of learning reviewed in the related work. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Perhaps because software can be marvelously complex, there is less of a design studio culture for software. Many }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Written rubrics can serve as a complement to peer review and design studio practices. For example, some }\DIFaddend software companies compose and maintain prescriptive style guides against which new code is carefully compared. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These guides }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, these guides may be more prescriptive than descriptive. In other words, they }\DIFaddend are not necessarily built on data about how software engineers actually design \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and write }\DIFaddend their code. %DIF > Code reviews, where peers give feedback on newly written code, are a standard practice in this industry.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend work in this thesis takes this idea farther. Rather than hope that the randomly assigned peer review experiences provides students with a sufficient variety of examples, the work in this thesis attempts to pull out the design dimensions as well as concrete examples along those dimensions and, when possible, ask students to engage with them in a targeted, personalized way. 

This may be helpful even at the level of introductory programming. For example, according to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Variation Theory}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variation theory}\DIFaddend , a student will understand the concept of a loop in a more generalized, robust way if they have seen all the different ways in which their peers have written that loop. The teacher can quickly and easily provide an expert \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend perspective by commenting on the popular and rare choices. Students can be overwhelmed by choices\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, e. g., "}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. For example, they might ask themselves, }{\it \DIFaddend Should I use \texttt{range} or \texttt{xrange}? Does it matter?\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{" }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin } \DIFaddend With concrete examples, teachers can help students identify what matters and what does not.

Two are most relevant in this work. First, the representation of the solution and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/or }\DIFdelend the measure of similiarity between solutions can ignore, hide, or otherwise fail to capture what the teacher cares about. Second, when \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(1) }\DIFaddend the teacher cannot \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{infer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{easily decide }\DIFaddend what a cluster \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"means " }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{means to them }\DIFaddend based on its members and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(2) }\DIFaddend the clustering algorithm cannot explicitly communicate why the cluster exists, the teacher may not trust the clustering and may not feel comfortable using it for propagating feedback and grades back to students. This is exacerbated when the teacher discovers a member of a cluster that seems not to belong.

The OverCode clustering pipeline attempts to escape the first clustering failure mode: erasing distinctions that the teacher may care about. For reasons discussed in detail in the OverCode chapter, OverCode is designed to reveal to the teacher what their students' solutions actually look like, modulo white space and comments. These solutions are rendered for the teacher using the most common variable names and statement orders. To stay true to what students actually wrote, this process preserves syntactic differences. For example, when iteratively exponentiating \texttt{base} to an exponent, there are multiple ways to multiply an accummulating variable \texttt{result} by \texttt{base} and save the product back into \texttt{result}, such as \texttt{result *= base} and \texttt{result = result * base}. If the teacher just gave a lecture on common forms of syntactic sugar, OverCode will be sensitive to whether or not students use it. OverCode would allow teachers to observe whether students absorbed the lesson on syntactic sugar based on the way they write their subsequent solutions. The fact that even small differences in syntax creates separate clusters within the OverCode pipeline nearly ensures that any syntactic choices a teacher is interested in has been preserved and can be filtered for in the interface.

First, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{there }\DIFaddend is a clear interpretation of what an OverCode cluster can and cannot include, based on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the canonicalized solutionthat represents it}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{its platonic solution}\DIFaddend .

Second, the differences between clusters is made clear by highlighting which lines make the non-reference clusters different from the reference cluster. Third, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode }\DIFaddend filtering features and rewrite rules help teachers change their view of solutions into one that preserves the differences they are explicitly interested in and ignores those they are not interested in. Note that filtering by semantic choices may only be possible when the work on Bayesian modeling of these solutions becomes more mature.

In general, the interfaces in this thesis cluster complex objects and visualize those clusters so that there is little guesswork about what is included and excluded in a group and what the boundary between groups is. There are no outliers that are grouped with something else without explanation. Rather than losing faith in the clustering process, outliers can be used as the teacher sees fit to spur improvements either to the software infrastructure of the course, e.g., the input-output testing harness, or the examples students are asked to engage with.

It is not surprising that the evolving values of variables would carry significant semantic meaning in code written by students at the introductory level in languages like Python and Matlab, especially if the style of programming is procedural. This thesis confirms that within the context of introductory procedural Python programs. According to Taherkhani et al.~\cite{taherkhani2010recognizing}, variables carry useful semantic meaning in object-oriented and functional programming styles as well. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Taherkhani et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddend \section{Limitations}

The thesis presents a series of case studies about how to present the variety of programming solutions in a human-interpretable way and make use of it in pedagogically valuable, scalable ways. The methods described only work in a particular domain of solutions: \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{those that are executable and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{executable programs that }\DIFaddend solve the same programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem}\DIFaddend . This excludes natural language, for example. These case studies embody the design principles espoused, but there is no validated unifying recipe by which a corpus of student solutions can be processed and used. Each corpus and set of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{teachers' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher }\DIFaddend values were considered together in order to engineer a representation of solutions--both in the pipeline and in the user interface--that would empower teachers and benefit students. There are many specific technical limitations of the approaches described in the previous chapters. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In the next chapter, the section on future work describes these limitations and suggests next steps.
