\section*{Preface}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
I am not a professional software developer, but learning how to write programs in middle school was one of the most empowering skills my father could ever have taught me. I did not need access to chemicals or heavy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{machinery--just }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{machinery. I only needed }\DIFaddend a computer and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, occasionally , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{occasionally }\DIFaddend an internet connection. I acquired datasets and wrote programs to extract interesting patterns in them. It \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was--and still is--a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was and still is a }\DIFaddend creative outlet.

More recently, the value of learning how to code, or at least how to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"think computationally" }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{think computationally, }\DIFaddend has gained national attention. Last September, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that all public schools in NYC will be required to offer computer science to all students by 2025. In January of this year, the White House released its Computer Science \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend All initiative, "offering every student the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hands-on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hands--on }\DIFaddend computer science and math classes that make them \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{job-ready }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{job--ready }\DIFaddend on day one" (President Obama, 2016 State of the Union Address).

The economic value and employment prospects associated with knowing how to program, the subsiding stigma of being \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"a computer geek}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a computer "geek" or "nerd}\DIFaddend ," and the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{production and }\DIFaddend popularity of movies about \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(now rich) programmers like The Social Network, has driven }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{programmers may be responsible for driving }\DIFaddend up enrollment in computer science classes to unprecedented levels. Hundreds or thousands of students enroll in programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{classes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{courses }\DIFaddend at schools like MIT, Stanford, Berkeley and the University of Washington.

One-on-one tutoring is considered a gold standard in education, and programming education is likely no exception. However, most students are not going to receive that kind of personalized instruction. We, as a computer science community, may not be able to offer one-on-one tutoring at a massive scale, but can we create systems that enhance the teacher and student experiences in massive classrooms in ways that would never have been possible in one-on-one tutoring? This thesis is one particular approach to answering that question. %are not even possible in just a one-on-one environment?% How can we best teach the next generation of students how to code when there are so many of them?

\DIFdel{I am indebted to many people who both directly and indirectly
contributed to this thesis. First, Iwould like to thank those
collaborators who directly contributed.  Most of all, I'm grateful
for the help and friendship of Mark Styczynski. Mark was my
collaborator on all matters computational for the past four years
--- his influence is evident throughout this document.  I'm also grateful for my collaboration with Christopher Loose, who performed
many of the experiments on antimicrobial peptides described in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:amps}.  Finally, I would like to thank Isidore Rigoutsos, who
straddled the line between collaborator and advisor.  Isidore taught
me an attention to detail and a penchant for the UNIX command line
and vi editor.

\DIFdel{Most importantly, I am indebted to Greg Stephanopoulos, my advisor,
whose guidance and support was unwavering these past six years. Greg
is the perpetual optimist --- always positive in the face of my many
failures along the way. He also gave me the freedom to pursue
projects of my own choosing, which contributed greatly to my
academic independence, if not the selection of wise projects.

\DIFdel{I am much obliged to my thesis committee members: my advisor Greg, Isidore, Bill Green, and Bob Berwick.  My committee was always
flexible in scheduling and judicious in their application of both
carrots and sticks.

I'm also grateful to my past internship mentors at Google and MSR, specifically Dan Russell, Merrie Ringel Morris, and Andr\'{e}s Monroy-Hern\'{a}ndez, who gave me the chance to try out my chops in new environments. I also want to thank my friends outside MIT, especially the greater Boston community of wrestling coaches, who helped me learn important lessons outside the classroom.
