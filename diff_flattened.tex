For students, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{innovative new student solutions and instructive examples. Understanding solution variation could help teachers write better feedback, test cases, and evaluation rubrics. Theories of learning, e.g., analogical learning and variation theory, suggest that students would benefit from understanding }\DIFaddend the variation in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a large class means that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their peers' solutions as well.

This thesis describes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{three systems that explore the value of solution variation in large-scale programming and simulated digital circuit classes.

It helps students reflect on their debugging or optimization process \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend generates hints that can help other students with the same problem\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and could potentially bootstrap an intelligent tutor tailored to the problem}\DIFdelend . These systems demonstrate how clustering and visualizing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{student solutions helps teachers and students provide types of one-on-one design feedback at scale that was previously only possible in a small classroom or one-on-one tutoring. The design choices around which these scaled-up forms of feedback rest can be curated by teachers directly from trends and outliers within the students' own solutions. The feedback generated by both teachers and students can be re-used by future students who attempt the same programming or hardware design problem.

\section*{Preface}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
I am not a professional software developer, but learning how to write programs in middle school was one of the most empowering skills my father could ever have taught me. I did not need access to chemicals or heavy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{machinery--just }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{machinery. I only needed }\DIFaddend a computer and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, occasionally , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{occasionally }\DIFaddend an internet connection. I acquired datasets and wrote programs to extract interesting patterns in them. It \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was--and still is--a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was and still is a }\DIFaddend creative outlet.

More recently, the value of learning how to code, or at least how to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"think computationally" }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{think computationally, }\DIFaddend has gained national attention. Last September, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that all public schools in NYC will be required to offer computer science to all students by 2025. In January of this year, the White House released its Computer Science \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend All initiative, "offering every student the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hands-on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hands--on }\DIFaddend computer science and math classes that make them \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{job-ready }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{job--ready }\DIFaddend on day one" (President Obama, 2016 State of the Union Address).

The economic value and employment prospects associated with knowing how to program, the subsiding stigma of being \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"a computer geek}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a computer "geek" or "nerd}\DIFaddend ," and the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{production and }\DIFaddend popularity of movies about \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(now rich) programmers like The Social Network, has driven }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{programmers may be responsible for driving }\DIFaddend up enrollment in computer science classes to unprecedented levels. Hundreds or thousands of students enroll in programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{classes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{courses }\DIFaddend at schools like MIT, Stanford, Berkeley and the University of Washington.

One-on-one tutoring is considered a gold standard in education, and programming education is likely no exception. However, most students are not going to receive that kind of personalized instruction. We, as a computer science community, may not be able to offer one-on-one tutoring at a massive scale, but can we create systems that enhance the teacher and student experiences in massive classrooms in ways that would never have been possible in one-on-one tutoring?

\DIFdel{When I was in elementary school, I wanted a pet. Specifically, I wanted a pet robot that could learn from human interaction. Nothing fancy, just some associative learning so that I could pat it on the head while saying its name and its software would eventually figure out that that particular sequence of syllables referred to itself.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{My dad told methat one way to create this hypothetical learning pet robot was to start with its brain. To do that, I'd need to learn how to program. I still remember the thrill of accomplishment after sitting down together with a Student Version of Matlab for three whole hours on a Saturday afternoon, stepping through for loops, printing variable values and iterating through arrays, figuring out how to harness the the computer one programming construct at a time. If the program was wrong, I could change the file of instructions and run it again--over and over again if necessary, until it worked the way I wanted it to.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{By ninth grade, I'd finally finished programming my hypothetical pet robot's ear. By tenth grade, I'd made a lot of progress toward programming its mouth. However, by then, I'd also outgrown the original idea of a learning pet robot. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Ihaven't outgrown the idea that programming is deeply creative and incredibly powerful. Someone who programs can autonomously control objects in the physical world and manipulate abstract ideas, like the likelihood of observations given some assumptions. Programming is the biggest force multiplier of human effort humanity has ever developed.

\DIFdel{At MIT and Stanford, so many students take a programming course that it is practically a general institute requirement. Outside traditional schools, students can learn programming online from organizations like edX and Kahn Academy or from developer bootcamps that promise a good paying job after less than six months of intense training. New York City and the US Federal Government have both recently announced initiatives designed to expose every student to programming, or at least computational thinking, before they graduate from high school. }%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{I was lucky; I got one-on-one personal tutoring, which is considered the gold-standard in terms of educational outcomes \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

. The glut of students trying to learn programming is inflating class sizes into the hundreds or thousands at schools like MIT, Stanford and Berkeley. The rapid, personalized feedback and attention that is possible within a one-on-one tutoring relationship becomes prohibitively painful or expensive. To me, the obvious answer to handling the growing demand for programming education is, of course, also programming. The only remaining question is ``how."

\section{\DIFadd{Solution Variation}}

\DIFadd{The taxonomy for }{\it \DIFadd{solution variation}} \DIFadd{used in this thesis has three branches: correctness, approach, }\DIFaddend and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trade-offs, augmented by computation behind the scenes. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{readability. Since correctness is difficult to prove for an arbitrary piece of code, it is approximated in industry and education by correctness with respect to a set of test cases. In education, the machinery that checks for correctness is often called an autograder.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The challenge of scaling up computer science education is usually framed as simply coping with the problems of large class sizes. This thesis, however, explores how the volume of students and their solutions can be exploited to enable new types of rapid personalized feedback, as well as recover aspects of a traditional small class}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There is a wide range of solutions that pass all the test cases and are labeled correct by the autograder, but they are not all equally good. Figure~\ref{table:diffapproaches} shows three different solutions of widely varying approach and readability that are correct with respect to the autograder test cases.

For example, a student might be subversive and disregard a request by the teacher to solve the problem without using an existing equivalent library function.

\DIFadd{Readability is the third critical component of solution variation. Poorly written solutions like the one in Figure~\ref{table:diffapproaches} may be both the symptom and the cause of student confusion. Unreadable code is harder to understand and debug, for both teacher and student. In industry, peer-to-peer code reviews help prevent code with poor readability from entering code bases, where it can be difficult and costly to maintain.

\section{\DIFadd{A Challenge and an Opportunity}}

\DIFadd{When teachers may have hundreds or thousands of raw student solutions to the same problem, it becomes arduous or impractical to review them by hand. And yet, only testing for approximate correctness via test cases has been automated. Identifying student solution approaches and readability automatically are still open areas of research. Given the volume and variety of student solutions, how do teachers comprehend what their students wrote? How do they give feedback on approach and readability at scale? 
}

\DIFadd{What value can }{\it \DIFadd{only}} \DIFadd{be extracted from a massive programming class? This thesis focuses on the opportunity posed by exploiting solution variation within large datasets of student solutions to the same problem. With algorithms, visualizations and interfaces, teachers may learn from their students by exposing student solutions they did not know about before. Teachers could find better examples to pull out for discussion. Teachers could write better feedback, test cases, and evaluation rubrics, given new knowledge of the distribution of student solutions across the dimensions of correctness, approach, and readability. And students could be tapped as experts on the solutions they create and the bugs they fix}\DIFaddend .

\section{A Tale of Two Turing Machines}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This work began after midnight in the basement computer lab of the Stata Center, where a student was struggling to create a Turing Machine that could detect whether a string of open and closed parentheses was properly balanced. If he was not successful within the next day or two, he would fail Computer Architecture (6.004). I will refer to him as Paul. I had a hard time helping Paul turn his Turing machine into one that would pass all the automatic grader's test tapes. I }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A short story about my time as a teaching assistant illustrates some of the challenges posed by solution variation. Students were programming simulated Turing machines, which compute by reading and writing to a simulated infinitely long tape. I struggled to help a student whose approach was not familiar to me. I }\DIFaddend could not tell if \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{his approach could work with a little debugging or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the approach }\DIFaddend was fatally flawed \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or unusual and possibly innovative}\DIFaddend . I did not want to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{demoralize him by telling him to abandon his efforts so far and start over unless it was truly necessary. And what if he was on the path to a novel solution no one else had created before?
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dissuade him from a novel idea simply because I did not recognize it.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{While not a necessary condition for the correctness of his intended approach, finding a similar working solution in the pool of previous student submissions would serve as an existence proof and evidence that he should persevere.
I had copies of hundreds of other students' correct Turing machines, but it was difficult to see by inspection whether any of these solutions were successful implementations of his intended approach. This was due to both superficial static and dynamic differences between solutions. There are two sources of static superficial differences: (1) students design their own symbol library and state names for the finite state machine portion of their Turing machine (2) students can list behavioral specifications in terms of their custom symbol and state names in any arbitrary order. Each behavior-specifying rule is a computer-readable version of the form ``if you're in state X and you read symbol Y on the tape, overwrite symbol Y with symbol Z, move the tape-reader in direction W, and transition to state Q." Dynamic superficial differences arise because even after translating these textual statements into a finite state machine diagram, the diagrams look very different from one correct solution to the next.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Eventually, through trial and error, he got his Turing Machine to work on all the test tapes, and passed the course. But I was deeply troubled by the experience. I felt like the information was there, in our staff server, but my brain could not see through the superficial textual differences nor mentally execute all the studentsolutions I had access to in order to have the perspective that would have helped me help Paul, when I could not see the bugs in his Turing Machine directly. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{After the semester ended, I looked into this further. I ran all the correct two-state Turing machines collected during the semester on the same test tape containing a string of open and closed parentheses. The movement of the tape-reading head across this input was logged in coordinates relative to the common starting point, at the left end of the test tape, and displayed along the vertical axis. The horizontal axis represents the number of steps taken by the Turing machine on its way to completing the task. These discrete steps are analogous to time. 
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The majority (88\% ) of the solutions employ one of two mutually exclusive strategies. These strategies were identified just from visual inspection of the movement of many Turing machines across the common test tape. Figure \ref{turingFig} shows their locations on the common input tape over time, separated by strategy into Figures \ref{tapeMoveA} and \ref{tapeMoveB}. These two strategies for determining whether or not the tape's string of parentheses is balanced are (1) matching the innermost open parenthesis with the innermost closed parenthesis, i. e., standard semantic interpretation in math, and (2) matching the $n^{th}$ }%DIFDELCMD < \todo{fix this font} %%%
\DIFdel{open parenthesis with the $n^{th}$ closed parenthesis. The remaining 12}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The staff server had thousands of previously submitted correct student solutions, but I could not easily see if one of them successfully employed the same approach as the one envisioned by the struggling student. After experimenting with different representations, I found a visualization of Turing machine behavior on test cases that separated 90\% of the correct student solutions into two main approaches~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ICERGlassman}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The remaining approximately 10}\DIFaddend \% of solutions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(not shown) include }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{included }\DIFaddend less common strategies. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This analysis also exposes room for improvement in the suite of test tapes: at least two strategies in this group are known to pass the test tapes but are actually incorrect because they cannot handle an arbitrary depth of nested parentheses. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Each staff member is encouraged to complete the Turing Machine lab on their own before counseling students. 
\DIFdel{Staff members were aware of the Turing machine solution they each had found on their own time, and yet were }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Two solutions passed all test cases but subverted teacher instructions.

\DIFdel{In order to perform more comprehensive clustering, several extensions of the original OverCode clustering methods have been explored and some have been fully implemented. GroverCode is an extension of OverCode built to canonicalize and cluster both correct and incorrect solutions. This was also done in the context of hundreds of exam-level solutions instead of thousands of solutions to "finger exercises" and problem set problems. This change in regime was inspired by need-finding interviews with the lecturer who teaches both the online and residential versions of MIT's introductory Python programming class. She was appreciative of the insights OverCode could give her extracted from the thousands of correct solutions submitted by her online students, but the semi-regular pain of hand-grading the hundreds of incorrect solutions submitted by tuition-paying residential students was a more immediate concern. Adapting to the needs of a team of graders grading a smaller number of more complex solutions, many of which were incorrect, required significant changes to the pipeline and interface. The resulting system was deployed to the staff for use during two grading sessions. The results of this field deployment are also promising; the staff welcomes its continued use in future semesters. More preliminary explorations of statistical methods for clustering solutions are also described.

\section{Thesis Overview}

Chapter \ref{chapter:relatedwork} summarizes prior and contemporary relevant research on systems that support programming education. It also briefly explains theories from the learning sciences and psychology literature that influenced or support the pedagogical value of the design choices made within this thesis.

The four chapters that follow describe, in detail, the four systems developed, as well as their evaluation on archived data or in the field.

 \begin{itemize} 
\item OverCode (Chapter \ref{chapter:overcode}) visualizes thousands of programming solutions using static and dynamic analysis to cluster similar solutions. It lets teachers quickly develop a high-level view of student understanding and misconceptions and provide feedback that is relevant to many student solutions. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It also describes GroverCode, an extension of OverCode optimized for grading correct and incorrect student solutions.
}\DIFaddend 

\item Foobaz (Chapter \ref{chapter:foobaz}) clusters variables in student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{programs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solutions }\DIFaddend by their names and behavior so that teachers can give feedback on variable naming. Rather than requiring the teacher to comment on thousands of students individually, Foobaz generates personalized quizzes that help students evaluate their own names by comparing them with good and bad names from other students. 

\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ClassOverflow (Chapter \ref{chapter:classoverflow} ) collects and organizes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Chapter \ref{chapter:classoverflow} describes two workflows that collect and organize }\DIFaddend solution hints indexed by \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(1) }\DIFaddend the autograder test that failed or \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(2) }\DIFaddend a performance characteristic like size or speed. It helps students reflect on their debugging or optimization process, generates hints that can help other students with the same problem, and could potentially bootstrap an intelligent tutor tailored to the problem.

\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode Extensions (Chapter \ref{chapter:grovercode} ) describes (1) GroverCode, an extension to OverCode optimized for processing and displaying incorrect as well as correct student submissions and (2) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Chapter \ref{chapter:grovercode} describes Bayesian }\DIFaddend clustering and mixture modeling algorithms applied to the OverCode pipeline \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s output for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{output for extracting }\DIFaddend additional insight into patterns within student solutions. 
%DIF < The GroverCode user interface is optimized and deployed in the field for teachers awarding partial credit to each of the hundreds of students who submitted programs in computer-based quizzes and final exams for the residential Python-based introductory programming (6.0001) and data science (6.0002) courses at MIT.
 \end{itemize} 

Chapter \ref{chapter:discussion} discusses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the design lessons that apply to the entire collection of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{some of the insights that came out of building and testing the }\DIFaddend systems in this thesis. Chapter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{chapter:futurework} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{chapter:conclusion} }\DIFaddend outlines avenues of future work \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this thesis work}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on the systems and ideas in this thesis}\DIFaddend , in combination with the complementary work of others in this space\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, paves the way for.

Last September, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that all public schools in NYC will be required to offer computer science to all students by 2025. In January, the White House released its “Computer Science For All” initiative, “offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one” (President Obama, 2016 State of the Union Address).

Fusion is the final pattern of variation, where the learner is exposed to examples that vary along all the dimensions of variation at once, since this is most commonly encountered in the real world.

Their Webzeitgeist design mining platform allows users to query a repository of hundreds of thousands of web pages based on the properties of their Document Object Model (DOM) tree and the look of the rendered page.

Ideally, code is not just correct, it is simple, readable, and ready for the inevitable need for future changes~\cite{peters2010zen,6005notes}. How can we help students reach this level of programming composition zen? How can we learn from others' code, even after we become competent, or even an expert, at the art of programming?

For the same reason we look at patterns in design across web pages and mobile apps, we can look at the design choices already made by humans who share their programs. Rather than using web crawlers or app stores, we can process millions of public repositories hosted online. What can we learn about good and bad code design decisions from these collections?

These code analysis techniques that follow are most closely related to those developed for OverCode and Foobaz. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend OverCode and Foobaz \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend pipelines are optimized for user interfaces that help users answer design mining questions about their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' compositions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student solutions }\DIFaddend and put the code front and center.

%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Mining Idioms}}
\DIFaddend 

Idiomatic code is written in a manner that experienced programmers perceive as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"normal " or "natural. " }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal or natural. }\DIFaddend Idioms are roughly equivalent to mental \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"chunks." }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{chunks, i.e., the memory units characterized by George Miller~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{An experienced Java programmer will be able to understand the code whether it's idiomatic or not, but it may take longer. They may even be distracted by questions, e.g., "Why did the author make this choice?"
}\DIFdelend %DIF > An experienced Java programmer will be able to understand the code whether it's idiomatic or not, but it may take longer. They may even be distracted by questions, e.g., {\it Why did the author make this choice?}

Fast et al.~\cite{codex} break the definition of idioms into two levels. An example of a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"}\DIFdelend high-level \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{" }\DIFdelend idiom is code that initializes a nested hash. An example of a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"}\DIFdelend low-level \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{" }\DIFdelend idiom is code that returns the result of an addition operation. Some languages support a variety of different, equally good ways to do the same thing\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; others }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Others }\DIFaddend encourage a single, idiomatic way to achieve each task.

Idioms can and do recur throughout distinct projects and domains (unlike repeated code nearly verbatim, i.e., clones) and commonly involve syntactic sugar (unlike API patterns). In general, clone detectors look for the largest repeated code fragments and API mining algorithms look for frequently used sequences of API calls. Idiom mining is distinct because idioms have syntactic structure and are often wrapped around or interleaved with context-dependent blocks of code\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, like the block of statements within an the idiomatic for loop in the previous paragraph.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.%DIF > , like the block of statements within an the idiomatic for loop in the previous paragraph.
}\DIFaddend 

There are enough idioms for some languages that they have lengthy, highly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"starred" }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{bookmarked }\DIFaddend and shared online guides. StackOverflow has many questions asked and answered about the appropriate language or library-specific idioms for particular, common tasks. It is difficult for expert users of each language or library to catalogue all the idioms. It is much more practical to simply look at how programmers are using the language or library and extract idioms from the data.

Hindle et al.~\cite{Hindle2012} used statistical language models from natural language processing to identify idiom-like patterns in Java code. They found that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{corpus-based }\DIFdelend n-gram language models \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{captured }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{built by analyzing corporacaptured }\DIFaddend a high level of project- and domain-specific local regularity in programs. Local regularities are valuable for statistical machine translation of natural language\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; they }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. They }\DIFaddend may prove useful in analogous tasks for software as well. For example, the authors trained and tested \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a corpus-based }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an }\DIFaddend n-gram model token suggestion engine that looks at the previous two tokens already entered into the text buffer and predicts the next one the programmer might type.

Allamanis and Sutton~\cite{allamanis2014mining} automatically mine idioms from a corpus of idiomatic code using nonparametric Bayesian tree substitution grammars. The mined idioms correspond to important programming concepts, e.g., object creation, exception handling, and resource management, and are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as expected, }\DIFdelend often library-specific. They found that 67\% of the idioms mined from one set of open source projects were also found in code snippets posted on StackOverflow.

Fast et al.~\cite{codex} computed statistics about the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of three million lines of popular open source code in the 100 most popular Ruby projects hosted on Github. AST nodes are normalized, and all identical normalized nodes are collapsed into a single database entry. The unparsed code snippets that correspond to each normalized node are saved. Codex normalizes these snippets by renaming variable identifiers, strings, symbols, and numbers to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{var0, var1, var2, str0, str1}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{var0}}\DIFadd{, }\texttt{\DIFadd{var1}}\DIFadd{, }\texttt{\DIFadd{var2}}\DIFadd{, }\texttt{\DIFadd{str0}}\DIFadd{, }\texttt{\DIFadd{str1}}\DIFaddend , etc. Note that this fails when primitives, like specific strings and numbers, are vital to interpreting the purpose of the statement.

The resulting system, Codex, can warn programmers when they chain or compose functions, place a method call in a block, or pass an argument to a function that is infrequently seen in the corpus. It is fast enough to run in the background of an IDE, highlighting problem statements and annotating them with messages like, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{?\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``}\DIFaddend We have seen the function split 30,000 times and strip 20,000 times, but \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we?\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we'}\DIFaddend ve never seen them chained together.\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{?\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'' }\DIFaddend Codex can be queried for nodes by code complexity; type, i.e., function call; frequency of occurrence across files and projects; and containment of particular strings.

%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Mining Larger Patterns in Code}}
\DIFaddend 

In the code of working applications, Ammons et al.~\cite{ammons2002mining} observed that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{?\DIFdelend common behavior is often correct\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{behavior. ?\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. }\DIFaddend Based on that observation, they use probabilistic learning from program execution traces to infer the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{program?\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{program'}\DIFaddend s formal correctness specifications. Inferring formal specifications for programs is valuable because programmers have historically been reluctant to write them. During program execution, the authors summarize frequent patterns as state machines that can be inspected by the programmer. As a result, the authors identified correct protocols and some previously unknown bugs.

Buse and Weimer~\cite{buse2012synthesizing} go beyond idioms to mining API \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{useage}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{usage}\DIFaddend . Based on a corpus of Java code, they find examples that reference a target class, symbolically execute it to compute intraprocedural path predicates while recording all subexpression values, identify expressions that correspond to one use of the class, capture the order of method calls in those concrete examples, then use \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{K-mediods }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{K-medoids }\DIFaddend to cluster these extracted concrete use examples with a custom formal parameterized distance metric that penalizes for differences in method ordering and type information. Concrete use examples within the same cluster are merged into abstract uses represented as graphs with edge weights that correspond to counts of how many times node X happens before node Y. Finally, they have a synthesis method to express these abstract use graphs in a human-readable form, i.e., representative, well-formed, and well-typed Java code fragments.

\DIFdelbegin \subsubsection{\DIFdel{Mining Names}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{subsubsection}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Mining Names}}
\DIFaddend 

Without modifying execution, names can express to the human reader the type and purpose of an object, as well as suggest the kinds of operators used to manipulate it~\cite{jones2008operand}. Perhaps as a direct result, variable names can exhibit some of the same regularity exhibited by code, in general. H{{\o{}}}st and {{\O{}}}stvold~\cite{host2008java} go so far as to call method names a restricted natural language they dubbed Programmer English.

H{{\o{}}}st and {{\O{}}}stvold~\cite{host2008java} ran an analysis pipeline on a corpus of Java that performs semantic analysis on methods and grammatical analysis on method names\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. It }\DIFaddend generates a data-driven phrasebook that Java programmers can use when naming methods. In a second publication~\cite{host2009debugging}, they formally defined and then automatically identified method naming bugs in code, i.e., giving a method a name that incorrectly implies what the method takes as an argument or does with an argument.

They did this by identifying prevalent naming patterns, e.g., contains-*, which occur in over half of the applications in the corpus and match at least 100 method instances. They also determined and cataloged the attributes of each method body, such as whether it read or wrote fields, created new objects, or threw exceptions. If almost all the methods whose names match a particular pattern, e.g., contains-*, have an attribute or do not have some other attribute, it \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend automatically determined to be an implementation rule that all names in the corpus should follow. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{On }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When run on }\DIFaddend a large corpus of Java projects, this analysis pipeline found a variety of naming bugs.

Fast et al.'s Codex~\cite{codex} produced similar results\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. By }\DIFaddend keeping track of variable names in variable assignment statements, it can warn programmers when their variable name violates \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{statistically-established }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{statistically established }\DIFaddend naming conventions, such as the (probably confusing) naming of a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Hash object "array." 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hash object ``array.'' 
}\DIFaddend 

Foobaz can go beyond Fast et al.~\cite{codex} and H{{\o{}}}st and {{\O{}}}stvold's~\cite{host2008java,host2009debugging} work in providing feedback on variable names because all solutions are known to address the same programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem}\DIFaddend .

However, it was not until 2011, that the first full university level course was made available to the public, complete with college-level programming exercises. Soon after, several organizations, e.g., edX, Coursera, and Udacity, started up to provide similar experiences for a range of university courses.

However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this regularity from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student-written code may not exhibit the same regularity as code written by software developers contributing to an open source project.

}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Unlike corpuses of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It is easier to run student solutions than code in }\DIFaddend open source projects\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, it is often not difficult to go beyond static analysis and perform dynamic analyses while executing each solution in the corpus.

}\DIFaddend 

Also unlike \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{corpuses }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corpora }\DIFaddend of open source code, the solutions in large \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{corpuses }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corpora }\DIFaddend of student code often require feedback, so that the author can learn. Automated feedback on solutions to programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercises }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problems }\DIFaddend is still an area of active research. For example, assigning grades based solely on the number of teacher-designed tests the code passes may not capture what teachers care to grade on. A single error in a solution can cause a near-perfect solution to fail all test cases. A solution can perform perfectly on test cases but be poorly written or violate instructions, e.g., use the wrong algorithm to achieve the right results. The test cases themselves may be poorly designed. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For these reasons, the teaching staff of 6.0001 at MIT review every exam solution from each student by hand. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Some teachers hand-review hundreds of exam solutions because the autograder output is not sufficient to assign grades. %DIF > For these reasons, the teaching staff of 6.0001 at MIT review every exam solution from each student by hand.
}\DIFaddend 

When \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{teachers have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a course has }\DIFaddend hundreds or thousands of students, it can be challenging to provide feedback to each solution quickly and consistently by hand. Design mining techniques and interfaces can help teachers explore and understand the whole space of solutions as well as distribute feedback to specific subsets of solutions, or subsets within solutions. It could be an important tool to assist in the sometimes difficult, manual task of identifying pedagogically valuable examples for illuminating a concept or principle. Distributing feedback can also be approached as an unsupervised or supervised, possibly interactive, machine learning problem, by leveraging clustering, classification, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clone detection, and }\DIFaddend mixture modeling methods. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Clustering also need not be done by machine learning methods; clone detection methods can identify clones at a variety of levels~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Just as the authors of Webzeitgeist defined sets of features to be computed for each node in a web page \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend DOM~\cite{webzeitgeist}, there are many sets of features used to estimate program similarity in the literature. Aggrawal et al.~\cite{srikant2014system}, Elenbogen and Seliya~\cite{Elenbogen}, Roger ~\cite{ACESthesis}, Rees~\cite{Rees:1982}, Huang et al.~\cite{MOOCshop}, Kaleeswaran et al.~\cite{kaleeswaran2016semi}, and Taherkhani et al.~\cite{taherkhani2010recognizing} each defined a set of features that could be computed automatically for each solution and represented as a numerical feature vector. These feature sets each include \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a mixture of static and/}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{static }\DIFaddend or dynamic features. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Some include both.
}\DIFaddend 

Static features include \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but are not limited to counts of the solution's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{counts of }\DIFaddend various keywords and tokens \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the solution}\DIFaddend , e.g., control flow keywords, operators, constants, and external function calls; counts of each type of expression in the solution;  measures of code complexity; length of commented code; scores from linting scripts; function name lengths; line lengths; and entire solution lengths. To quantify the goodness of a solution's style, AutoStyle~\cite{choudhury2016autostyle} used \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a pre-existing metric called }\DIFdelend the ABC score, a weighted count of assignments, branches, and conditional statements in a block of code.

Dynamic features include \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but are not limited to }\DIFdelend data collected from running a solution on each test case, e.g., the solution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend output and whether or not it is correct with respect to the teacher \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend specification, the evolution of values assigned to each variable within the solution, and the order in which statements in the solution are executed. For example, Huang et al.~\cite{MOOCshop} create an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'output vector ' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{output vector }\DIFaddend for each solution: a binary vector representing the solution's correctness on each test case. For approximately one million solutions to 42 programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercises Stanford's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problems collected from the }\DIFaddend original Machine Learning MOOC \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{offered by Stanford}\DIFaddend , the authors found that a teacher could cover 90\% of solutions or more in almost all problems by annotating the top 50 output vectors. However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this could be difficult; }\DIFdelend the authors acknowledge that many different mistakes can produce \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend the same output vector.

\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Variable behavior is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{another }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend specific kind of dynamic feature that merits additional description. Just as there is evidence that experts subconsciously internalize {\it control flow plans}, like the Running Total Loop Plan that accumulates partial totals, there is evidence that experts subconsciously internalize {\it variable plans} ~\cite{variableplans}. Variable plans are characterized by the function or role that it serves in a function, how it is initialized and updated, and conditional statements on the variable's value. 

Empirically, the number of distinct variable roles found in introductory-level programs is small. While reviewing three introductory programming textbooks written for Pascal, Sajaniemi~\cite{sajaniemi2002empirical} hand-labeled the role of variables within each provided example program, based only on the pattern of successive values each variable took on. Nine variable roles, e.g., \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'stepper' and '}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``stepper'' and ``}\DIFaddend one-way flag\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{''}\DIFaddend , covered 99\% of the variables in all 109 programs found in those textbooks. Sajaniemi notes that a single variable can switch roles during execution, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'properly ' or 'sporadically'}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{properly or sporadically}\DIFaddend . A proper switch is when its final value while serving in one role is its initial value when serving in the next role. A sporadic switch is one in which the variable is reset to a new value at some point, to serve a new role that may or may not have anything to do with its previous role. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \todo{find and look at green1985programmer--The Programmer's Torch--to summarize how it's different, based on sajaniemi2002empirical's description} %%%
\DIFdelend Sajaniemi has been credited for creating what is now \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{called }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{known }\DIFaddend in the literature as role of variables theory. 

Further work independently confirms and operationalizes Sajaniemi's insights. Taherkhani et al. ~\cite{taherkhani2010recognizing} found that 11 variable roles cover all variables in novice-level programs, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming styles, and went further to automatically classify algorithms based on variables and some additional features. Gulwani et al.~\cite{gulwani_fse14} also depend on variable behavior to recognize different algorithmic approaches\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; they }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. They }\DIFaddend ask teachers to annotate source code, by hand, with key values that differentiate algorithmic approaches. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Gulwani et al.'s work was published at a conference six months after the submission of the OverCode manuscript to TOCHI.
}\DIFdelend %DIF > Gulwani et al.'s work was published at a conference six months after the submission of the OverCode manuscript to TOCHI.

OverCode and Foobaz make use of a pipeline that characterizes each solution as (1) a set of variables, which are distinguished from each other by their dynamic behavior during execution on test cases, (2) a set of one-line statements \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend in a novel way by those identified variables and (3) the solution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend outputs in response to each test case. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{After OverCode's publication, }\DIFdelend Gulwani et al.~\cite{gulwani2016automated} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{used }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{uses }\DIFaddend the same variable value tracing method to cluster solutions, augmenting it with information about control flow structure to overcome syntactic differences between solutions.

\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Statistical }\DIFaddend natural language processing techniques can also be applied to code, preferably after preprocessing. For example, Biegel et al.~\cite{Biegel} described how $w$-shingling can capture local patterns within a solution. The $w$-shingling of a solution is the set of all unique subsequences of $w$ tokens it contains \cite{BRODER19971157}. The resemblance $r$ between two solutions is defined as the number of unique subsequences of $w$ tokens both solutions contain, normalized (divided) by the union of unique subsequences of $w$ tokens contained in either solution. It other words, it is the Jaccard coefficient of the two solutions' $w$-shinglings. The resemblance distance is defined as $1-r$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; it is a metric that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which }\DIFaddend obeys the triangle inequality. $n$-grams models are like $w$-shinglings except instead of capturing just the {\it set} of unique subsequences of a certain length, they also capture a more global feature: the relative frequencies of these unique subsequences in the entire solution or corpus. Similarly, representing Python programs as TF-IDF vectors calculated from counts of tokens, e.g., keywords, collected across the entire corpus of solutions can capture \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{individual solution's deviations from whole-corpus }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{deviations from corpus }\DIFaddend trends~\cite{Gaudencio}.

CCFinder~\cite{CCFinder} and MOSS~\cite{schleimer2003winnowing} (Measure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend Software Similarity) are both \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{pair-wise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pair wise }\DIFaddend similarity (clone) detectors.

\DIFdelend %DIF >  \subsubsection{Structure-based features and distance functions}

The structure of solutions can be represented as trees, i.e., ASTs, and graphs, e.g., data dependency and control flow graphs. Binary or numerical feature vectors can be computed from the graphs, as well as graph-to-graph metrics of similarity, for use in feedback or assessment~\cite{Robinson:1980,srikant2014system}. Recent literature uses the full AST for computing pairwise distance metrics, e.g., the tree edit distance (TED). TED is defined as the minimum cost sequence of node edits that transforms one AST into another, given some \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{set of costs on types of edits}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cost function}\DIFaddend .

%The tree edit distance (TED) between two ASTs is the minimum cost sequence of node edits that transforms one AST into another, given some set of costs on types of edits. 

While a naive TED algorithm scales very poorly with tree size, an optimized TED algorithm~\cite{shasha1994exact} makes this computation more feasible\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The optimized algorithm }\DIFaddend is only quadratic in both the number of solutions and the size of their ASTs~\cite{MOOCshop}. In contrast, the analysis pipeline used by both OverCode and Foobaz \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clusters solutions }\DIFdelend scales linearly with the number and size of solutions. 

Huang et al.~\cite{MOOCshop} used the optimized TED algorithm to process approximately a million solutions while executing on a computing cluster. The same analysis pipeline was used by Roger et al.~\cite{ACESthesis}. Yin et al.~\cite{yin2015clustering} defined a normalized TED that weighs edits associated with nodes closer to the tree root more heavily than nodes closer to the leaves. This prioritizes high-level structural similarities between solutions and de-emphasizes minor differences in syntax near the AST leaves.

Luxton-Reilly et al.~\cite{Luxton13} develop a hierarchical clustering taxonomy for types of solution variations, from high- to low-level: structural, syntactic, or presentation-related. The structural similarity between solutions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in a dataset }\DIFdelend is captured by comparing their control flow graphs.

\DIFaddend There is a particularly rich literature on Bayesian mixture models. The following methods are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{potentially useful in the context of OverCode}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{particularly relevant to modeling code as mixtures of choices}\DIFaddend :
 \begin{itemize} 
\item Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)~\cite{bleiLDA} is a mixture model that is typically applied to natural language. In that context, it learns \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"topics"}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{topics}\DIFaddend , i.e., distributions over words, as well as the distributions over topics found in each document. %DIF < , which is typically applied to corpuses of documents could model solutions as "documents" with sets of "words," where each word belongs to one topic and each document can contain words from multiple topics.
%DIF > , which is typically applied to corpora of documents could model solutions as "documents" with sets of "words," where each word belongs to one topic and each document can contain words from multiple topics.
\item Correlated Topic Models (CTM)~\cite{} are like LDA but topics are no longer assumed to be independent. In other words, the topics learned by the model can be correlated. If it \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend possible to formulate the inputs such that the learned latent topics represent design decisions, this could capture the reality that design choices are not independent of each other in code composition.
\item Hierarchical Dirichlet Process \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Models (HDPs) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(HDP) model}\DIFaddend ~\cite{}, like DPMMs, do not require a pre-set number of clusters. Unlike DPMMs, solutions do not belong to a single cluster. Like LDA, solutions contain features, and each feature belongs to a cluster. Solutions can contain features from multiple clusters. This method emulates LDA with no pre-set number of clusters.

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Visualizing and Interacting with Student Solutions}}

\DIFaddend There are several existing visualizations or interfaces that help \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers and students }\DIFaddend understand how solutions vary within a large corpus of solutions to a common problem\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and/or why a given set of solutions are grouped together.

These code-specific comparison tools may match methods rather than just comparing lines. Three panes side-by-side are used to show code during three-way merges of file differences.

These tools do not scale beyond comparing a handful of programs simultaneously.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. A common design choice is to map each solution to a point in some feature space. Huang et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend 

%Cody\footnote{\url{mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody}} is an informal learning environment for the Matlab programming language that presents learners with {\em solution maps}. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In contrast, the solutions maps in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Ned Gulley designed solutions maps for }\DIFaddend Cody, a Matlab programming game\footnote{\url{mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody}}, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to }\DIFaddend help users pick and compare pairs of solutions from hundreds of solutions to the same programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem}\DIFaddend . The solution map plots each solution as a point against two axes: time of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solution }\DIFaddend submission on the horizontal axis, and code size on the vertical axis, where code size is the number of nodes in the parse tree of the solution. Users can select pairs of points to see the code they correspond to side-by-side beneath the solution map. Despite the simplicity of this metric, solution maps can provide quick and valuable insight when exploring differences among large numbers of solutions~\cite{ICERGlassman}. This can help game players learn alternative, possibly better, ways to solve a problem using the Matlab programming language, including its extensive libraries.

Huang et al.~\cite{MOOCshop} and Rogers et al.~\cite{ACESthesis} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have an alternative but still point-based representation of hundreds or thousands of solutions. They }\DIFdelend create graphs where each node is a solution and links between nodes indicate similarity scores beneath a certain threshold. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Inter-Node }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Inter-node }\DIFaddend and inter-cluster distances correspond to syntactic similarity. Clusters are colored using modularity, a measure of how well a network decomposes into modular communities. Rogers et al.~\cite{ACESthesis} built a grading interface on top of this clustering process\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; graders }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Graders }\DIFaddend graded one solution at a time, grouped by cluster.

AutoStyle~\cite{choudhury2016autostyle} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also uses a point-based display of solutions. The authors }\DIFdelend visualize all solutions on the screen using a t-SNE 2D visualization. Similar to the previous clustering interfaces, each point represents a solution and its color indicates its cluster. Hovering over a point reveals the solution it represents. Using this interface, teachers hand-annotate each cluster with a label, i.e., \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'good', 'average', or 'weak' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``good'', ``average'', or ``weak'' }\DIFaddend and a hint about how to improve the solution. For each cluster, the teacher must also choose an exemplar solution from a {\it slightly better} cluster as an example of what to shoot for.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In contrast to point-based displays, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tools that are not built for representing an entire corpus, such as file comparison tools, do have useful features to consider when designing new interfaces.

\DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend OverCode interface puts the code front and center, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{synthesizing platonic solutions that represent entire stacks of solutions, }\DIFaddend borrowing display techniques from file comparison tools, adding filtering mechanisms and interactive clustering through rewrite rules on top of the clustering done by the analysis pipeline. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The pipeline' s clustering criteria allows the user interface to efficiently "name" clusters with a representative exemplar solution automatically. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OverCode was also inspired by information visualization projects like WordSeer \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

%DIF < \subsection{Handling Incorrect Solutions}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{More generally, several interfaces have been designed for providing grades or feedback to students at scale, and for browsing large collections in general, not just student solutions. The powergrading paradigm \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{basupowergrading} }%DIFAUXCMD
enables teachers to assign grades or write feedback to many similar answers at once. Their interface focused on powergrading for short-answer questions from the U.S. Citizenship exam. After machine learning clustered answers, the frontend allowed teachers to read, grade, or provide feedback on similar answers simultaneously. When compared against a baseline interface, the teachers assigned grades to students substantially faster, gave more feedback to students, and developed a ``high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions'' \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddbegin \section{\DIFadd{Teaching Principles}}


\DIFadd{This section describes ideas and techniques from educational psychology and the learning sciences that influenced this thesis work. The systems in this thesis are designed to support teachers and students in massive classrooms. For example, one way to support teachers is to give them a better idea of the solution space, so they can better help a student one-on-one. Another way to support teachers is to deploy personalized prompts that mimic what the teacher might have said to the student if they could interact one-on-one.
}

\DIFadd{One-on-one or small group tutoring has been held up as a gold standard in education since 1984 when Bloom published a collection of his lab's work demonstrating tutoring's efficacy relative to other experimental and conventional methods at the time~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{bloom}}%DIFAUXCMD
. For example, his lab found that, after 11 sessions of instruction in probability or cartography, elementary and middle school students who received tutoring in groups of one to three were, on average, two standard deviations better than their counterparts in a conventional 30-person classroom. Given the expense of scaling up one-on-one tutoring, Bloom challenged the academic community to find a method of group instruction that was just as good, or better. This became known as Bloom's two sigma problem.
%DIF > That challenge still stands as a benchmark that modern systems and techniques can compare against. While I do not measure the relative learning gains associated with the systems presented in this thesis, I do relate key design decisions to the tutoring best practices that are able to be scaled up or automated, such as prompting for self-explanations.% evidence from the learning sciences The focus on this thesis is on developing systems that scale up what good tutors and teachers do.
}

%DIF > \subsection{Self-Explanations and Reflection}

\DIFadd{Foobaz and the learnersourcing workflows explicitly prompt students to reflect and generate explanations on their own. These explanations are helpful to others, but they are also helpful to the student who generated them. These explanations, sometimes called self-explanations, foster the integration of new knowledge. Effective tutors encourage self-explanation by prompting students with questions like }{\it \DIFadd{Why?}} \DIFadd{and }{\it \DIFadd{How?}}\DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{selfexplanation}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Students of tutors who fostered self-explanations had learning gains similar to those whose tutors provided their own explanations and feedback\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{chi2001learning}}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
}

\DIFadd{Self-explanations are a form of reflection, which is a critical method for triggering the transformation from conflict and doubt into clarity and coherence~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{dewey1933}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Turns et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{asee} }%DIFAUXCMD
argue that the absence of reflection in traditional engineering education is a significant shortcoming. This thesis contributes systems designed, in part, to address that shortcoming.
}


%DIF > \subsection{Deliberate Practice and Rapid Feedback}

%DIF > Ericsson is one of the foremost experts on how learners can efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge and skills, like those necessary for becoming an effective programmer. 

\DIFadd{OverCode and Foobaz are designed to help teachers give faster and more personalized feedback to massive numbers of introductory programming students. Rapid personalized feedback supports learning in foundational engineering classrooms \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ieeeRapidFeedback}}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
}

\DIFadd{Rapid feedback is also a critical part of deliberate practice, a targeted form of concentrated practice that helps build a specific skill. Deliberate practice is goal-directed, effortful, repetitive, accompanied by rapid feedback, and only sustained as long as the learner can be fully concentrated on the task, i.e., no more than a few hours~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Gobet2012}}%DIFAUXCMD
. For example, rather than just playing pickup basketball games in the neighborhood, an aspiring professional player might design specific drills to work on his/her weaknesses. Recent work incorporaing deliberate practice in large classrooms has demonstrated great benefits. A recent study of undergraduate physics classrooms found that, with deliberate practice as a base of the instructional design, improvements can approach and exceed Bloom's 2-sigma threshold~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Deslauriers862}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}

\DIFadd{Teachers help facilitate deliberate practice, because they can design appropriate exercises and provide feedback until the student can differentiate between good and bad performance and provide that feedback to themselves. Following this pattern of instruction, Foobaz introduces a new way for teachers to provide systematic personalized feedback on good and bad variable names. The student can use this feedback to improve their own solutions and build up their own mental model about variable names are good and bad.
}

 %DIF > Another recent study confirms the value of rapid feedback in foundational engineering classrooms \cite{ieeeRapidFeedback}. 

%DIF > This thesis contributes systems designed to provide feedback on some aspects of programming tasks where it was not feasible to do so before, such as Foobaz, which stimulates reflection and provides feedback on one of the most basic forms of program readability: variable names.\todo{ROBTODO: REWRITE AND FLESH OUT INTO ITS OWN PARAGRAPH.}

%DIF > \subsection{Zone of Proximal Development and Scaffolding}

\DIFadd{The comparison learnersourcing workflow was designed with zones of proximal development (ZPD) and scaffolding in mind. The workflow dictates showing students better and worse solutions, relative to the solution they generated on their own. Some solutions are optimized in ways that may make them difficult to understand for a student who struggled just to make a working, non-optimized solution. Teachers who use the comparison workflow can decide whether students are prompted to reflect on slightly better and worse solution or radically better and worse solutions. Ideally, these better and worse solutions are not so different, they are outside a student's theoretical zone of proximal development.
}

\DIFadd{The concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) was first introduced in the mid-1920's by the Soviet pyschologist Lev Vygotsky. It refers to the gap between what a learner can do without help and what a learner cannot yet do, no matter how much help they are given. It is implied that an object of learning strictly outside the ZPD is either too easy or too hard, and little or no learning will occur.
}

\DIFadd{Wood et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{woodscaffolding} }%DIFAUXCMD
introduced a complementary process called scaffolding. Scaffolding enables a learner to solve problems or achieve goals that would ordinarily be beyond their grasp because the teacher controls the aspects of the task that are initially outside the learner's abilities. Recent work suggests that the maximum learning gains come from giving students the hardest possible tasks they are able, with the assistance of scaffolding, to complete~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{zpd14}}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
}

\DIFadd{Formative feedback~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{formative} }%DIFAUXCMD
can be helpful as part of the scaffolding. It should non-evaluative, supportive, timely, and specific. It usually arrives as a hint, an explanation, or a verification based on the student answer. Likewise, the comparison workflow, identifies where a student solution is on the spectrum of optimality and prompts the student to reflect on a better solution, such as the next most optimal one.
}

\section{\DIFadd{Learning through Variation in Examples}}

\DIFadd{The work in this thesis is deeply influenced by multiple theories about the role of variation in learning. Designing sets of examples that illuminate an object of learning can have signifiant effects on how students understand, generalize, and transfer their learning to new contexts. This section summarizes these theories and how they have been applied in studies of human learning.
}

%DIF > Studies of tutors and their students help us identify characteristics and styles of interaction that help explain the effectiveness of tutoring. Some of these can be successfully deployed in large classrooms. However, the way we frame content can also have large effects on how students understand, generalize, and transfer their learning to new contexts.

\DIFadd{Concrete examples of an object of learning--like how to apply an appropriate statistical test in a statistics word problem--vary in ways that may be superficial or fundamental. In the language of educational psychologists, these are often called surface and structural features ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{quilicimayer}}%DIFAUXCMD
. A simple compare and contrast exercise when solving equations~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{rittle2007does} }%DIFAUXCMD
or examining case studies in negotiation~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{loewenstein2003analogical} }%DIFAUXCMD
can bring this variation to the fore, and yield learning benefits.
}

\DIFadd{Learning in the presence of variation in these features helps learners generalize and transfer their knowledge to new situations, such as better transfer of geometric problem solving skills~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{workedexamplesvariability,Variabilityofpractice}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Several educational models, e.g., variation theory and the 4C/ID Model~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{van2002blueprints}}%DIFAUXCMD
, build on the value of variability by suggesting specific ways for how it should be deployed in the classroom. The three components in this thesis, OverCode, Foobaz, and the targeted learnersourcing workflows, are all designed to make the natural variability present in student solutions useful to teachers and students, in accordance with recommendations from the educational theories that follow.
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Analogical Learning}}

\DIFadd{Analogies are central to human cognition. They can help learners understand and transfer knowledge and skills to new situations. Analogical learning is at play both when learners have a base of knowledge that they bring with them to a novel target and when they compare two partially understood situations that can illuminate each other~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{kurtz01learning,loewenstein2003analogical}}%DIFAUXCMD
. However, in order to reap the full benefits of analogical learning, learners must engage deeply. Reading two cases, serially, in a session is not enough. Learners will not necessarily make the necessary connections unless there are explicit instructions to compare~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{loewenstein2003analogical,catrambone1989overcoming}}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
}

\DIFadd{Kolodner~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Kolodner} }%DIFAUXCMD
suggests creating software tools that align examples to facilitate analogical learning. This thesis is, in part, a response to this suggestion. The comparison learnersourcing workflow pairs solutions the student wrote themselves with solutions that are novel to them. They are prompted to compare the solutions and write a hint for future students.
}

\DIFadd{Novices may become confused if asked to compare their solution to a fellow student's solution. This is not necessarily bad for learning outcomes. Piaget theorized that cognitive disequilibrium, experienced as confusion, could trigger learning due to the creation or restructuring of knowledge schema~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{disequilibrium}}%DIFAUXCMD
. D'Mello et al. maintain that confusion can be productive, as long as it is both appropriately injected and resolved~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{productiveconfusion}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Similarly, reflecting on a peer's conceptual development or alternative solution may bring about cognitive conflict that prompts reevaluation of the student's own beliefs and understanding \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{kavanagh}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The comparison workflow component of this thesis is designed to stimulate this kind of productive confusion, comparison, and resolution through self-explanation. %DIF > \todo{DNHT: add Towards Providing Feedback to Students in Absence of Formalized Domain Models by Sebastian Gross, Bassam Mokbel, Barbara Hammer, Niels Pinkwart}
}

\DIFadd{Analogical learning can be very difficult. For example, the structural features may be aligned between a base and the new target situation, but large differences in surface features will hurt the learner's ability to see any connection~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Kurtz}}%DIFAUXCMD
. This may be explained by how human memory works. For novices, the most reliable form of retrieval is based on surface similarity, not deep analogical similarity. Experts can more easily retrieve situations that are structurally similar and therefore more relevant for a new situation at hand~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Loewenstein}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Variation theory, discussed next, is specifically designed to help students more deeply appreciate structural features, which may help them transfer their learning to new situations instead of feeling lost, confused by superficial differences.
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Variation Theory}}

\DIFadd{Variation theory (VT)~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{marton1997learning} }%DIFAUXCMD
views learning and understanding as discernment, specifically of the various features of objects and concepts that define what they are. An aphorism captures the ideas at the heart of variation theory well: }{\it \DIFadd{He cannot, England know, who knows England only.}} \DIFadd{VT is concerned with the way in which students are taught from concrete examples. It is relatively new and still being investigated for its usefulness in a broad range of disciplines, including mathematics and computer science.%DIF > \todo{add more specific definition of VT} 
}

\DIFadd{VT is built on the understanding that learning is not possible unless the learner can discern what the object of learning is~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{marton1997learning}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Discernment is not possible without experiencing variation in the object of learning and the world in which it is situated~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{marton2004classroom}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Dimensions of variation are described by features~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ling2012variation}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\footnote{\DIFadd{In variation theory literature, the nomenclature is similar but distinct from that of machine learning: features are referred to as aspects and feature values are referred to as features.}}\DIFadd{. Some feature values are irrelevant, while critical feature values collectively define the object of learning.
}

\DIFadd{Through the lens of machine learning, VT asserts that human learning can suffer from overfitting for some of the same reasons that machine learning algorithms do. If a machine learning algorithm selects the the color of the sky as the key difference between photos of cats and dogs (which is obviously unrelated to distinguishing between photos of cats and dogs), then a possible explanation is that the algorithm was trained on photos with insufficient or biased variation. If all the cat photos it ever saw were taken on a cloudy day, and all the dog photos it ever saw were taken on a sunny day, could you blame this naive program for latching on to this obvious differentiator of housepet species? Humans can make the same inferential mistake when not exposed to a sufficient variety of examples of an object of learning. VT catalogues a hierarchy of patterns of variation designed to immunize the learner to this kind of mistake.
}

%DIF > This variation is described in terms of aspects and features. An aspect refers to a dimension of variation, and a feature is a value of that dimension of variation~\cite{ling2012variation}. Some features are irrelevant, while critical features collectively define the object of learning.

\DIFadd{For a more concrete discussion of variation, consider the following examples:
} \begin{enumerate} 
\item \DIFadd{The phrase }{\it \DIFadd{a heavy object}} \DIFadd{might not make sense to the reader unless they have interacted with objects of various weights.
}\item \DIFadd{Consider a child who recently learned how to add numbers, but always starts with the larger number: 2+1=3, 4+2=6, etc. Asking the child to add the numbers in the opposite order, smaller number first, and verify that the result is the same introduces the commutative feature of addition.
}\item \DIFadd{No matter how wildly a cup diverges from a prototypical example of a tea cup, if it does not have the critical feature of being able to hold something, it is not a cup.
} \end{enumerate} 

\DIFadd{Marton et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{marton1997learning} }%DIFAUXCMD
identify four patterns of variation: }{\it \DIFadd{contrast}}\DIFadd{, }{\it \DIFadd{separation}}\DIFadd{, }{\it \DIFadd{generalization}}\DIFadd{, and }{\it \DIFadd{fusion}}\DIFadd{. The contrast pattern of variation includes examples that differ by feature values that determine whether each example represents the object of learning. If a child is learning the concept of three, then contrast refers to being introduced to three apples, as well as a pair of apples, or a dozen. The generalization pattern highlights, through contrast, what about an object of learning remains constant while certain features vary. Using this pattern of variation, a child learning the concept of three might be introduced to different groups of three, e.g., three apples, three dogs, three beaches, and three languages. This clarifies that it is not the apples that give }{\it \DIFadd{three}} \DIFadd{its meaning. Separation refers to a pattern of examples that helps the learner separate a dimension of variation from other dimensions of variation. A child could be introduced to a litter of nearly identical puppies that only differ in coat color, for example. Fusion is the final pattern of variation, where the learner is exposed to examples that vary along all the dimensions of variation at once, since this is most commonly encountered in the real world. These patterns of variation are intended to reveal which aspects of a concept or phenomenon are superficial and irrelevant and which are innate and critical to its definition.

\DIFadd{Discussion forums derive their value from the content produced by the teachers and students who use them. These systems can harness the benefits of peer learning, where students can benefit from generating and receiving help from each other. However, as the system has no student model, the information is available to all students whether or not it is ultimately relevant. Students can receive personalized attention only if they post a question and receive a response. 
}

\DIFaddend Peer-pairing can stand in place of staff assistance, to both reduce the load on teaching staff and give students a chance to gain ownership of material through teaching it to someone else. Weld et al. speculate about peer-pairing in MOOCs based on student competency measures \cite{WeldHcomp12}, and Klemmer et al. demonstrate peer assessments' scalability to large online design-oriented classes~\cite{Klemmer}. Peer instruction~\cite{mazur} and peer assessment~\cite{peerassessment} have been integrated into many classroom activities and have also formed the basis of several online systems for peer-learning. For example, Talkabout organizes students into discussion groups based on characteristics such as gender or geographic balance \cite{talkabout}.

Recent work on learnersourcing proposes that learners can collectively generate educational content for future learners while engaging in a meaningful learning experience themselves \cite{kim2013learnersourcing,weir2015,mitros2015}. For example, Crowdy enables people to annotate how-to videos while simultaneously learning from the video \cite{weir2015}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Within the ClassOverflow work, I }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The targeted learnersourcing workflows presented in this thesis }\DIFaddend expand on learnersourcing by requesting the contributions of specific learners who, by virtue of their work so far, are uniquely situated to compose a hint for fellow learners. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I will refer to this as targeted learnersourcing}\DIFdelend %DIF > I will refer to this as targeted learnersourcing.

In MOOCs, a single programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem }\DIFaddend may produce thousands of solutions from learners. Understanding solution variation is important for providing appropriate feedback to students at scale.  The wide variation among these solutions can be a source of pedagogically valuable examples, and can be used to refine the autograder for the exercise by exposing corner cases. 
We present OverCode, a system for visualizing and exploring thousands of programming solutions. OverCode uses both static and dynamic analysis to cluster similar solutions, and lets teachers further filter and cluster solutions based on different criteria.
We evaluated OverCode against a non-clustering baseline in a within-subjects study with 24 teaching assistants, and found that the OverCode interface allows teachers to more quickly develop a high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions, and to provide feedback that is relevant to more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend solutions.

\DIFaddend \section{Introduction}

Intelligent tutoring systems (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ITSes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ITS}\DIFaddend ), Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and websites like Khan Academy and Codecademy are now used to teach programming courses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on }\DIFaddend a massive scale. In these courses, a single programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem }\DIFaddend may produce thousands of solutions from learners, which presents both an opportunity and a challenge. For teachers, the wide variation among these solutions can be a source of pedagogically valuable examples~\cite{marton13}, and understanding this variation is important for providing appropriate, tailored feedback to students~\cite{basupowergrading,MOOCshop}. The variation can also be useful for refining evaluation rubrics and exposing corner cases in automatic grading tests.

\end{figure*}

Sifting through thousands of solutions to understand their variation and find pedagogically valuable examples is a daunting task, even if the programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercises }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problems }\DIFaddend are simple and the solutions are only tens of lines of code long. Without tool support, a teacher may not read more than 50-100 of them before growing frustrated with the tedium of the task. Given this small sample size, teachers cannot be expected to develop a thorough understanding of the variety of strategies used to solve the problem, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or }\DIFdelend produce instructive feedback that is relevant to a large proportion of learners, or find unexpected interesting solutions.

An information visualization approach would enable teachers to explore the variation in solutions at scale. Existing techniques~\cite{gradingsigcse14,MOOCshop,codewebs} use a combination of clustering to group solutions that are semantically similar, and graph visualization to show the variation between these clusters. These clustering algorithms perform pairwise comparisons that are quadratic in both the number of solutions and in the size of each solution, which scales poorly to thousands of solutions. Graph visualization also struggles with how to label the graph node for a cluster, because it has been formed by a complex combination of code features. Without meaningful labels for clusters in the graph, the rich information \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the learners' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in student }\DIFaddend solutions is lost and the teacher's ability to understand variation is weakened.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In this paper we present }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter presents }\DIFaddend OverCode, a system for visualizing and exploring the variation in thousands of programming solutions. OverCode is designed to visualize correct solutions, in the sense that they already passed the automatic grading tests typically used in a programming class at scale. The autograder cannot offer any further feedback on these correct solutions, and yet there may still be good and bad variations on correct solutions that are pedagogically valuable to highlight and discuss. OverCode aims to help teachers understand solution variation so that they can provide appropriate feedback to students at scale.

OverCode uses a novel \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clustering technique that creates clusters of identical cleaned code, in time linear in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{human-interpretable solution clustering technique. The clustering process is linear in time with respect to }\DIFaddend both the number of solutions and the size of each solution. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution that represents each cluster }\DIFaddend is readable, executable, and describes every solution in that cluster \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.  The cleaned code is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in a deterministic way that accounts for both syntax and behavior on test cases. The platonic solutions are }\DIFaddend shown in a visualization that puts code front-and-center (Figure~\ref{overcode_fullinterface}). In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode, the teacher reads through code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode interface, teachers read through platonic }\DIFaddend solutions that each represent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an entire cluster of solutionsthat look and act the same}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{entire clusters of solutions}\DIFaddend . The differences between clusters are highlighted to help teachers discover and understand the variations among \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{submitted }\DIFdelend solutions. Clusters can be filtered by the lines of code within them.  Clusters can also be merged together with {\em rewrite rules} that collapse variations that the teacher decides are unimportant. 

A cluster in OverCode is a set of solutions that perform the same computations, but may use different variable names or statement order.  OverCode uses a lightweight dynamic analysis to generate clusters, which scales linearly with the number of solutions. It clusters solutions whose variables take the same sequence of values when executed on test inputs and whose set of constituent lines of code are syntactically the same. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend An important component of this analysis is to rename variables that behave the same across different solutions. The renaming of variables serves three main purposes. First, it lets teachers create a mental mapping between variable names and their behavior which is consistent across the entire set of solutions. This may reduce the cognitive load for a teacher to understand different solutions. Second, it helps clustering by reducing variation between similar solutions. Finally, it also helps make the remaining differences between different solutions more salient. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter concludes by presenting }\DIFaddend two user studies with a total of 24 participants who each looked at thousands of solutions from an introductory programming MOOC, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we compared }\DIFdelend the OverCode interface \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is compared }\DIFaddend with a baseline interface that showed original unclustered solutions. When using OverCode, participants felt that they were able to develop a better high-level view of the students' understandings and misconceptions. While participants didn't necessarily read more lines of code in the OverCode interface than in the baseline, the code they did read came from clusters containing a greater percentage of all the submitted solutions. Participants also drafted mock class forum posts about common good and bad solutions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. These forum posts }\DIFaddend were relevant to more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{solutions (and the students who wrote them) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student solutions }\DIFaddend when using OverCode as compared to the baseline. 

\section{OverCode} \label{overcode}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We now describe the OverCode user interface. OverCode }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OverCode }\DIFaddend is an information visualization application for teachers to explore student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{program solutions. The OverCode interface allows the user to scroll, filter, and }\emph{\DIFdel{stack}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{solutions. OverCode }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solutions. OverCode }\DIFaddend uses the metaphor of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stacks to denote collections }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solutions stacked on top of each other to denote a cluster }\DIFaddend of similar solutions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, where each stack shows a }\emph{\DIFdel{cleaned}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{solution from the corresponding collection of identical cleaned solutionsit represents. 
These cleaned solutions have strategically renamed variables and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The top solution in the stack is the platonic solution that represents all the other solutions in the stack. The OverCode interface allows the teacher to scroll through, filter, and merge stacks of solutions. 
}

\DIFadd{The platonic solutions that represent stacks are normalized in a novel way. Specifically, they have standardized formatting, no comments, and variable names that reflect the most popular naming choices across all solutions. They }\DIFaddend can be filtered by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend lines of code they contain \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Cleaned solutions can also be rewritten when users compose andapply a }\emph{\DIFdel{rewrite rule}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{, which can eliminate differences between cleaned solutions and therefore combine stacks of cleaned solutions that have become identical. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and, through rewrite rules, modified and merged. They are the result of the normalization process applied to all student solutions in the OverCode analysis pipeline. %DIF > They can also be rewritten when teachers compose and apply \emph{rewrite rules}, which can eliminate differences between platonic solutions and therefore merge stacks that have become identical after the rewrite. 
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We iteratively designed and developed the OverCode interface based on continuous evaluation by the authors, feedback from teachers and peers, and by consulting principles from the information visualization literature. }\DIFdelend %DIF > The OverCode interface was iteratively designed and developed based on continuous evaluation by the authors, feedback from teachers and peers, and by consulting principles from the information visualization literature. 
A screenshot of OverCode visualizing \codevar{iterPower}, one of the problems from our dataset, is shown in Figure~\ref{overcode_fullinterface}. In this section, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we describe }\DIFdelend the intended use cases and the user interface \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are described}\DIFaddend . In Section \ref{pipeline}, the backend program analysis pipeline is described in detail. 
\subsection{Target Users and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Applications}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tasks}\DIFaddend }
The target users of OverCode are teaching staff of introductory programming courses. Teaching staff may be undergraduate lab assistants who help students debug their code; graduate students who grade assignments, help students debug, and manage recitations and course forums; and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lecturing professors who also compose the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{instructors who compose }\DIFaddend major course assessments. Teachers using OverCode may be looking for common misconceptions, creating a grading rubric, or choosing pedagogically valuable examples to review with students in a future lesson.

\subsubsection{Misconceptions and Holes in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Student }\DIFaddend Knowledge}
Students just starting to learn programming can have a difficult time understanding the language constructs and different API methods. They may use them suboptimally, or in non-standard ways. OverCode may help instructors identify these common misconceptions and holes in knowledge, by highlighting the differences between stacks of solutions. Since the visualized solutions have already been tested and found correct by an autograder, these highlighted differences between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions may be convoluted variations in construct usage and API method choices that have not been flagged by the Python interpreter or caused the failure of a unit test. Convoluted code may suggest a misconception.

\DIFaddbegin \todo{Rob: it would be great to show example code for these tasks, ideally showing them in OverCode -- can you mine any examples from your thesis defense talk?}

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Grading Rubrics}
It is a difficult task to create grading rubrics for checking properties such as design and style of solutions. Therefore most autograders resort to checking only functional correctness of solutions by testing them against a test suite of input-output pairs. OverCode enables teachers to identify the style, structure, and relative frequency of the variation within correct solutions. Unlike traditional ways of creating a grading rubric, where an instructor may go through a set of solutions, revising the rubric along the way, instructors can use OverCode to first get a high-level overview of the variations before designing a corresponding rubric. Teachers may also see incorrect solutions not caught by the autograder.

\subsubsection{Pedagogically Valuable Examples} 
There can be a variety of ways to solve a given problem and express it in code. If an assignment allows students to generate different solutions, e.g., recursive or iterative, to fulfill the same input-output behavior, OverCode will show separate stacks for each of these different solutions, as well as stacks for every variant of those solutions. OverCode helps teachers filter through solutions to find different examples of solutions to the same problem, which may be pedagogically valuable. According to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Variation Theory }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variation theory }\DIFaddend ~\cite{marton13}, students can learn through concrete examples of these multiple solutions, which vary along \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{various }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{different }\DIFaddend conceptual dimensions.
\subsection{User Interface}

The OverCode user interface is the product of an iterative design process with multiple stages, including paper prototypes and low-fidelity \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{web-browser-based prototypes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{prototypes rendered in a web browser}\DIFaddend .  Prototype iterations were used and critiqued by members of our research group and by several teaching staff of an introductory Python programming course. While exploring the low-fidelity prototypes, these teachers talked aloud about their hopes for what the tool could do, frustrations with its current form, and their frustrations with existing solution-viewing tools and processes. This feedback was incorporated into the final design.

The OverCode user interface is divided into three columns. The top-left panel in the first column shows the problem name, the \emph{done} progress bar, the number of stacks, the number of visualized stacks given the current filters and rewrite rules, and the total number of solutions those visualized stacks contain. The panel below shows the largest stack \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that represents the most common solution}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of solutions}\DIFaddend . Side by side with the largest stack, the remaining \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{solution }\DIFdelend stacks appear in the second panel. Through scrolling, any stack can be horizontally aligned with the largest stack for easier comparison. The third panel has three different tabs that provide static and dynamic information about the solutions, and the ability to filter and combine stacks. 

As shown in Figure~\ref{overcode_fullinterface}, the default tab shows a list of lines of code that occur in different \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions together with their corresponding frequencies. The stacks can be filtered based on the occurrence of one or more lines (Filter tab). The column also has tabs for \emph{Rewrite} and \emph{Legend}. The Rewrite tab allows a teacher to provide rewrite rules to collapse different stacks with small differences into a larger single stack. The Legend tab shows the dynamic values that different program variables take during the execution of programs over a test case. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We now describe different features of OverCode in more detail.
}\DIFdelend %DIF > We now describe different features of OverCode in more detail.
\DIFaddbegin \todo{ROB:maybe the TOCHI paper didn't have space for screenshots of these, but your thesis needs them}
\DIFaddend 

\subsubsection{Stacks} A stack in OverCode denotes a set of similar solutions that are grouped together based on a similarity criterion defined in Section \ref{pipeline}. For example, a stack for the \codevar{iterPower} problem is shown in Figure~\ref{stacks}(a). The size of each stack\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, i.e., the number of solutions in a stack, }\DIFaddend is shown in a pillbox at the top-left corner of the stack. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The count denotes how many solutions are in the stack, and can also be referred to as the stack }%DIFDELCMD < {\it %%%
\DIFdel{size}%DIFDELCMD < }%%%
\DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend Stacks are listed in the scrollable second panel from largest to smallest. The solution on the top of the stack is a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solution that describes all the solutions in the stack. See Section \ref{pipeline} for details on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaning process }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing process that produces platonic solutions}\DIFaddend .

Each stack can also be clicked. After clicking a stack, the border color of the stack changes and the \emph{done} progress bar is updated to reflect the percentage of total solutions clicked, as shown in Figure~\ref{stacks}(b). This feature is intended to help \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend remember which stacks they have already read or analyzed, and keep track of their progress. Clicking on a large stack, which represents a significant fraction of the total solutions, is reflected by a large change in the \emph{done} progress bar. \todo{add that now the raw solutions inside the stack are also displayed, but this was not included during user study tests}

\label{stacks}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Showing Differences between Stacks} OverCode allows teachers to compare smaller stacks, shown in the second column, with the largest stack, shown in the first column. The lines of code in the second column that also appear in the set of lines in the largest stack are dimmed so that only the differences between the smaller stacks and the largest stack are apparent. For example, Figure~\ref{stackdifferences} shows the differences between the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions of the two largest stacks. In earlier iterations of the user interface, lines in stacks that were not shared with the largest stack were highlighted in yellow, but this produced a lot of visual noise. By dimming the lines in stacks that \textit{are} shared with the largest stack, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we reduced }\DIFdelend the visible noise \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is reduced}\DIFaddend , while still keeping differences between stacks salient.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.42]{Body/figures/overcode/lineFadingScreenshot}
\caption{Similar lines of code between two stacks are dimmed out such that only differences between the two stacks are apparent.}
\label{stackdifferences}
\end{figure*}



\subsubsection{Filtering Stacks by Lines of Code} The third column of OverCode shows the list of lines of code occurring in the solutions together with their frequencies (numbered pillboxes). The interface has a slider that can be used to change the threshold value, which denotes the number of solutions in which a line should appear for it to be included in the list. For example, by dragging the slider to $200$ in Figure~\ref{linefilter}(a), OverCode only shows lines of code that are present in at least $200$ solutions. This feature was added as a response to the length of the unfiltered list of code lines, which was long enough to make skimming for common code lines difficult.

Users can filter the stacks by selecting one or more lines of code from the list. After each selection, only stacks whose \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions have those selected lines of code are shown. Figure~\ref{linefilter}(b) shows a filtering of stacks that have a \codevar{for} loop, specifically the line of code \codevar{for i in range(expB)}, and that assign $1$ to the variable \codevar{result}.

\caption{(a) The slider allows filtering of the list of lines of code by the number of solutions in which they appear. (b) Clicking on a line of code adds it to the list of lines by which the stacks are filtered.}
\label{linefilter}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Rewrite Rules} There are often small differences between the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions that can lead to a large number of stacks for a teacher to review. OverCode provides \emph{rewrite rules} by which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend can collapse these differences and ignore variation they do not need to see. This feature comes from experience with early prototypes. After observing a difference between stacks, like the use of \codevar{xrange} instead of \codevar{range}, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend wanted to ignore that difference in order to more easily find other differences.

A rewrite rule is described with a left hand side and a right hand side as shown in Figure~\ref{rewriterule}(a). The semantics of a rewrite rule is to replace all occurrences of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{left hand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{left-hand }\DIFaddend side expression in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions with the corresponding \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{right hand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{right-hand }\DIFaddend side. As the rewrite rules are entered, OverCode presents a preview of the changes in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions as shown in Figure~\ref{rewriterule}(b). After the application of the rewrite rules, OverCode collapses stacks that now have the same \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions because of the rewrites. For example, after the application of the rewrite rule in Figure~\ref{rewriterule}(a), OverCode collapses the two biggest iterPower stacks from Figure~\ref{overcode_fullinterface} of sizes $1534$ and $374$, respectively, into a single stack of size $1908$. Other pairs of stacks whose differences have now been removed by the rewrite rule are also collapsed into single stacks. As shown in Figure~\ref{afterrewrite}(a), the number of stacks now drop from $862$ to $814$.

\label{afterrewrite}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Variable Legends} OverCode also shows the sequence of values that variables in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions take on, over the course of their execution on a test case. As described in Section~\ref{pipeline}, a variable is identified by the sequence of values it takes on during the execution of the test case. Figure~\ref{afterrewrite}(b) shows a snapshot of the variable values for the \codevar{iterPower} problem. The goal of presenting this dynamic information associated with common variable names is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to help users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{intended to help teachers (1) }\DIFaddend understand the behavior of each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned solution , and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution without having to mentally execute it on a test case and (2) }\DIFaddend further explore the variations among solutions that do not have the same common variables. When this legend was originally added to the user interface, clicking on a common variable name would filter for all solutions that contained an instance of that variable. Some pilot users found this feature confusing, rather than empowering. As a result, it was removed from OverCode before running both user studies. At least one study participant, upon realizing the value of the legend, wished that the original click-to-filter-by-variable functionality existed; it may be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{re-instated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reinstated }\DIFaddend in future versions.

\section{Implementation} \label{pipeline}
The OverCode user interface depends on an analysis pipeline that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalizes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizes }\DIFaddend solutions in a manner designed for human readability\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, referred to here as }\emph{\DIFdel{cleaning}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend . The pipeline then creates stacks of solutions that have become identical through the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaning }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing }\DIFaddend process. The pipeline accepts, as input, a set of solutions, expressed as function definitions for $f(a,...)$, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one test case $f(a_{1},...)$. We refer to the solutions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a set of test cases. Solutions }\DIFaddend that enter the pipeline \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are referred to }\DIFaddend as \emph{raw}, and the solutions that exit the pipeline as \emph{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clean}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal}\DIFaddend }. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To illustrate this pipeline, we will have a few running examples, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Examples, }\DIFaddend beginning with \codevar{iterPower}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, are presented below to illustrate this pipeline}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Analysis Pipeline}
OverCode is currently implemented for Python, but the pipeline steps described below could be readily generalized to other languages commonly used to teach programming.

{\bf 1. Reformat solutions.} For a consistent appearance, the solutions are reformatted \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with the PythonTidy package}\DIFaddend \footnote{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We used the PythonTidy package, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Created }\DIFaddend by Charles Curtis Rhode. \url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy/}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since our datasets are in Python, we use a Python-specific reformatting script. However, our approach is not language-specific.}\DIFdelend } to have consistent line indentation and token spacing. Comments and empty lines are also removed. These steps not only make solutions more readable, but also allow exact string matches between solutions, after additional \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaning }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing }\DIFaddend steps later in the pipeline. Although comments can contain valuable information, the variation in comments is so great that clustering and summarizing them will require significant additional design, which remains future work. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

{\bf 3. Extract variable sequences.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{During the previous step, the Python execution logger \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{pgbovineOPT} }%DIFAUXCMD
records the values of all in-scope variables after every statement execution in the Python program.

Figure~\ref{fig:extractsequence} shows the program trace for a solution run on a test case, as well as the extracted sequences of distinct values for each variable.

For example, in spite of the fact that the }\codevar{iterPower} \DIFadd{problem asked students to compute the exponential $\codevar{base}^\codevar{exp}$ }\textit{\DIFadd{iteratively}}\DIFaddend , \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{without considering how many statements were executed before the variable 's value changed.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The pipeline compares sets }\DIFaddend of lines of code because then solutions with arbitrarily ordered lines that do not depend on each other can still fall into the same stack. (Recall that the variables in these lines of code have already been renamed based on their dynamic behavior, and all the solutions have already been marked input-output correct by an autograder, prior to this pipeline.) The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solution that represents the stack is randomly chosen from within the stack, because all the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clean }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend solutions within the stack are identical, with the possible exception of the order of their statements. 

In the examples \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{below, the clean }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in Figure~\ref{fig:makingstacks}, the normal }\DIFaddend C and D solutions have the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exact }\DIFdelend same set of lines, and both provide correct output, with respect to the autograder. Therefore, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we assume that }\DIFdelend the difference in order of the statements between the two solutions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{does not need to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is not }\DIFaddend communicated to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{user}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher}\DIFaddend . The two solutions are put in the same stack, with one solution arbitrarily chosen as the visible \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend code. However, since Student A and Student B use different functions, i.e., \codevar{xrange} vs. \codevar{range}, and different operators, i.e., \codevar{*=} vs. \codevar{=,*}, the pipeline puts them in separate stacks.

The full program trace and output is recorded for every test case. 
}

\DIFadd{This logging of solution execution can be one of the longer steps in the OverCode analysis pipeline, so preprocessing occurs once per solution and is saved in its own pickle file. New solutions can be preprocessed once, without affecting previously preprocessed solutions. Batch processing takes, as input, all the existing preprocessed results and normalizes variable names. This must occur as a batch operation because variable renaming depends on the behavior and name of every variable in every solution.
}

\DIFadd{The program }\DIFaddend tracing \cite{pgbovineOPT} and renaming scripts occasionally generate errors while processing a solution. For example, the script may not have code to handle a particular but rare Python construct. Errors thrown by the scripts drive their development and are helpful for debugging. When errors occur while processing a particular solution, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we exclude the solution }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they are excluded }\DIFaddend from our analysis. Less than five percent of the solutions in each of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend three problem datasets are excluded.

\subsection{Variable Renaming Details and Limitations} \label{repercussions}

There are three distinct types of name collisions possible when renaming variables to be consistent across multiple solutions. The first, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which we refer to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{referred to here }\DIFaddend as a {\it common/common} collision, occurs when two common variables (with different variable sequences) have the same common name. The second, referred to here as a {\it multiple instances} collision, occurs when there are multiple different instances of the same common variable in a solution. The third and final collision, referred to as a {\it unique/common} collision, occurs when a unique variable's name collides with a common variable's name.

{\bf Common/common collision.} If common variables $cv_{1}$ and $cv_{2}$ are both most frequently named $i$ across all program traces, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we append }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the pipeline appends }\DIFaddend a modifier to the name of the less frequently used common variable. For example, if 500 program traces have an instance of $cv_{1}$ and only 250 program traces have an instance of $cv_{2}$, $cv_{1}$ will be named $i$ and $cv_{2}$ will be named $iB$.  

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is illustrated below. Across all thousand of }%DIFDELCMD < \codevar{iterPower} %%%
\DIFdel{definitions in our dataset}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For example}\DIFaddend , a subset of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{them }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \codevar{iterPower} \DIFadd{solutions }\DIFaddend created a variable that iterated through the values generated by \codevar{range(exp)}. Student A's code is an example. A smaller subset created a variable that iterated through the values generated by \codevar{range(1,exp+1)}, as seen in Student E's code. These are two separate common variables in our pipeline, due to their differing value sequences. The {\it common/common} name collision arises because both common variables are most frequently named \codevar{i} across all solutions to \codevar{iterPower}. To preserve the one-to-one mapping of variable name to value sequence across the entire \codevar{iterPower} problem dataset, the pipeline appends a modifier, \codevar{B}, to the common variable \codevar{i} found in fewer \codevar{iterPower} solutions. A common variable, also most commonly named \codevar{i}, which is found in even fewer \codevar{iterPower} definitions, will have a \codevar{C} appended, etc. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:commcommcoll}.

{\bf Multiple-instances collision.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We identify }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The pipeline identifies }\DIFaddend variables by their sequence of values (excluding consecutive duplicates), not by their given name in any particular solution. However, without considering the timing of variables' transitions between values, relative to other variables in scope at each step of a function execution, it is not possible to differentiate between multiple instances of a common variable within a single solution. 

Rather than injecting a name collision into an otherwise correct solution, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we chose to preserve the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the pipeline preserves the solution }\DIFaddend author's variable name choice for all the instances of that common variable in that solution. If \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a solution }\DIFaddend author's preserved variable name collides with any common variable name in any program trace and does not share that common variable's sequence of values, the pipeline appends a double underscore to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{authors }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solution author's }\DIFaddend preserved variable name, so that the interface, and the human reader, do not conflate them.

In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the following example}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure~\ref{fig:multiinst}}\DIFaddend , the solution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend author made a copy of the \codevar{exp} variable, called it \codevar{exp1}, and modified neither. Both map to the same common variable, \codevar{expB}. Therefore, both have had their author-given names preserved, with an underscore appended to the local \codevar{exp} so it does not look like common variable \codevar{exp}.

{\bf Unique/common collision.} Unique variables, as defined before, take on a sequence of values that is unique across all program traces. If a unique variable's name collides with any common variable name in any program trace, the pipeline appends a double underscore to the unique variable name, so that the interface, and the human reader, do not conflate them. 

In addition to the example of this collision in the description of common and variable naming in the previous section, we provide the example below. In this solution, the student added $1$ to the exponent variable before entering a \codevar{while} loop. No other students did this. To indicate that the \codevar{exp} variable is {\it unique} and does not share the same behavior as the common variable also named \codevar{exp}, our pipeline appends double underscores to \codevar{exp} in this one solution.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Unlike previous }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Clustering methods that use }\DIFaddend pairwise AST edit \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distance-based clustering approaches that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distance metrics }\DIFaddend have quadratic complexity both in the number of solutions and the size of the ASTs~\cite{MOOCshop}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The OverCode }\DIFaddend analysis pipeline has linear complexity in the number of solutions and in the size of the ASTs. The Reformat step performs a single pass over each solution for removing extra spaces, comments, and empty lines. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since we only consider correct solutions , we assume that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Given the assumption that all solutions in the pipeline are correct, }\DIFaddend each solution can be executed within a constant time that is independent of the number of solutions. The executions performed by the autograder for checking correctness could also be instrumented to obtain the program traces, so code is not unnecessarily re-executed. The identification of all common variables and unique variables across the program traces takes linear time as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we can hash }\DIFdelend the corresponding variable sequences \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and then check }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can be hashed and then checked }\DIFaddend for occurrences of identical sequences. The Renaming step, which includes handling name collisions, also performs a single pass over each solution. Finally, the Stacking step creates stacks of similar solutions by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{performing set-based equalityof lines of code that can also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{testing set equality, which can }\DIFaddend be performed in linear time by hashing the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{set of lines of code}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sets}\DIFaddend .


\section{Dataset} \label{dataset}

For evaluating both the analysis pipeline and the user interface of OverCode, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we use a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend dataset of solutions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is collected }\DIFaddend from 6.00x, an introductory programming course in Python that was offered on edX in fall 2012. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We chose Python solutions from three exercise problems , and this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Three exercise problems were chosen. This }\DIFaddend dataset consists of student solutions submitted within two weeks of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the posting of the those three problems. We obtained thousands of submissions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{each problem's release date.

The number of solutions analyzed for each problem is shown in Figure~\ref{overcode_solutioncounttable}.



%\caption{Our dataset of problems from an introductory programming course in Python, from Fall 2012.}
%\label{table-edx-probs}

 \begin{itemize} 
\item {\bf \codevar{iterPower}} The \codevar{iterPower} problem asks students to write a function to compute the exponential $\codevar{base}^\codevar{exp}$ iteratively using successive multiplications. This was an in-lecture exercise for the lecture on teaching iteration. See Figure \ref{ipexamples} for examples.
\item {\bf \codevar{hangman}} The \codevar{hangman} problem takes a string \codevar{secretWord} and a list of characters \codevar{lettersGuessed} as input, and asks students to write a function that returns a string where all letters in \codevar{secretWord} that are not present in the list \codevar{lettersGuessed} are replaced with an underscore. This was a part of the third week of problem set exercises. See Figure \ref{hmexamples} for examples.
\item {\bf \codevar{compDeriv}} The \codevar{compDeriv} problem requires students to write a Python function to compute the derivative of a polynomial, where the coefficients of the polynomial are represented as a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{python }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Python }\DIFaddend list. This was also a part of the third week of problem set exercises. See Figure \ref{cdexamples} for examples.
 \end{itemize} 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We chose these three exercises for our dataset }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The three exercises were selected for analysis }\DIFaddend because they are representative of the typical exercises students solve in the early weeks of an introductory programming course. The three exercises have varying levels of complexity and ask students to perform loop computation over three fundamental Python data types, integers (\codevar{iterPower}), strings (\codevar{hangman}), and lists (\codevar{compDeriv}). The exercises span the second and third weeks of the course in which they were assigned.

\section{OverCode Analysis Pipeline Evaluation}
We now present the evaluation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode }\DIFaddend analysis pipeline implementation on our Python dataset. We first present the running time of our algorithm and show that it can generate stacks within \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend few minutes for each problem on a laptop. We then present the distribution of initial stack sizes generated by the pipeline. Finally, we present some examples of the common variables identified by the pipeline and report on the number of cases where name collisions are handled during the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaning }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing }\DIFaddend process. The evaluation was performed on a Macbook Pro 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM. %DIF > \todo{remove we's} 

{\bf Running Time} The complexity of the pipeline that generates stacks of solutions grows linearly in the number of solutions as described in Section~\ref{complexity}. Figure~\ref{backendevaluation} reports the running time of the pipeline on the problems in the dataset as well as the number of stacks and the number of common variables found across each of the problems. As can be seen from the Figure, the pipeline is able to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clean }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalize }\DIFaddend thousands of student solutions and generate stacks within \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend few minutes for each problem.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Running time and the number of stacks and common variables generated by the OverCode backend implementation on our dataset problems.}
\label{backendevaluation}
\end{figure*}

{\bf Distribution of Stacks} The distribution of initial stack sizes generated by the analysis pipeline for different problems is shown in Figure~\ref{stackdistribution}. Note that the two axes of the graph corresponding to the size and the number of stacks are shown on a logarithmic scale. For each problem, we observe that there are a few large stacks and a lot of smaller stacks (particularly of size 1). The largest stack for \codevar{iterPower} problem consists of $1534$ solutions, while the largest stacks for \codevar{hangman} and \codevar{compDeriv} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consists }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{consist }\DIFaddend of $97$ and $22$ solutions\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend respectively. The two largest stacks \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with the corresponding cleaned solutions }\DIFdelend for each problem are shown in Figure~\ref{toptwostacks}. 

The number of stacks consisting of a single solution for \codevar{iterPower}, \codevar{hangman}, and \codevar{compDeriv} are $684$, $452$, and $959$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend respectively. Some singleton stacks are the same as one of the largest stacks, except for a unique choice, such as initializing a variable using several \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{additional }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{more }\DIFaddend significant digits than necessary: \codevar{result=1.000} instead of \codevar{result=1} or \codevar{result=1.0}. Other singleton stacks have convoluted control flow that no other student used. 

These variations are compounded by inclusion of unnecessary statements that do not affect input-output behavior. An existing stack may have all the same lines of code except for the unnecessary line(s), which cause the solution to instead be a singleton. These unnecessary lines may reveal misconceptions, and therefore are potentially interesting to teachers. In future versions, rewrite rules may be expanded to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{allow }\DIFdelend include line removal rules, so that teachers can remove inconsequential extra lines and cause singleton(s) to merge with other stacks. 

The tail of singleton solutions is long, and cannot be read in its entirety by teachers. Even so, the user studies indicate that teachers still extracted significant value from OverCode presentation of solutions. It may be that the largest stacks are the primary sources of information, and singletons can be ignored without a significant effect on the value teachers get from OverCode. Future work will explore ways to suggest rewrite and removal rules that maximally collapse stacks.

{\bf Common Variables} There exists a large variation among the variable names used by students to denote variables that compute the same set of values. The Variable Renaming step of the analysis renames these equivalent variables with the most frequently chosen variable name so that a teacher can easily recognize the role of variables in a given solution. The number of common variables found by the pipeline on the dataset problems is shown in Figure~\ref{backendevaluation} and some examples of these common variable names are shown in Figure~\ref{examplecommonvars}. Figure~\ref{examplecommonvars} also presents the number of times such a variable occurs across the solutions of a given problem, the corresponding variable sequence value on a given test input, and a subset of the original variable names used in the student solutions.

{\bf Collisions in Variable Renaming} The number of Common/Common, Multiple Instances, and Unique/Common collisions discovered and resolved while performing variable renaming is shown in Figure~\ref{collisions}. A large majority of the collisions were Common/Common Collisions. For example, Figure~\ref{examplecommonvars} shows the common variable name \codevar{exp} for two different sequences of values $[3,2,1,0]$ and $[3]$ for the \codevar{iterPower} problem. Similarly, the common variable name \codevar{i} corresponds to sequences $[-13.9, 0.0, 17.5, 3.0, 1.0$ and $[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ for the \codevar{compDeriv} problem. There were also a few Multiple Instances collisions and Unique/Common collisions found: 1.5\% for \codevar{iterPower}, 3\% for \codevar{compDeriv}, and 10\% for \codevar{hangman}.

\section{User \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Study 1: Writing a Class Forum Post}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Studies}\DIFaddend }
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend goal was to design a system that allows teachers to develop a better understanding of the variation in student solutions, and give feedback that is relevant to more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' solutions. We designed two user studies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student solutions. Two user studies were designed }\DIFaddend to evaluate our progress in two ways: (1) user interface satisfaction and (2) how many solutions teachers could read and produce feedback on in a fixed amount of time. Reading and providing feedback to thousands of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{submissions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solutions }\DIFaddend is an unrealistically difficult task for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend control condition, so instead of measuring time to finish the entire set of solutions, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we sought to measure what our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the experiment measures what }\DIFaddend subjects could accomplish in a fixed amount of time (15 minutes).

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Together, these studies test four hypotheses:
} \begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{\DIFadd{H1 Interface Satisfaction}} \DIFadd{Subjects will find OverCode easier to use, more helpful and less overwhelming for browsing thousands of solutions, compared to the baseline. 
}

\item {\bf \DIFadd{H2 Read coverage and speed}} \DIFadd{Subjects are able to read code that represents more student solutions at a higher rate using OverCode than with the baseline. 
}

\item {\bf \DIFadd{H3 Feedback coverage}} \DIFadd{Feedback produced when using OverCode is relevant to more student solutions than when feedback is produced using the baseline.
}

\item {\bf \DIFadd{H4 Perceived coverage}} \DIFadd{Subjects feel that they develop a better high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions, and provide more relevant feedback using OverCode than with the baseline.
}

 \end{itemize} 

\subsection{\DIFadd{User Study 1: Writing a Class Forum Post}}

\DIFaddend The first study was a 12-person within-subjects evaluation of interface satisfaction when using OverCode for a realistic, relatively unstructured task. Using either OverCode or a baseline interface, subjects were asked to browse student solutions to the programming problems in our dataset and then write a class forum post on the good and bad ways students solved the problem. Through this study, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we sought to test our first hypothesis :

\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We designed two interfaces }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Two interfaces were designed}\DIFaddend , referred to here as OverCode and the baseline. The OverCode interface and backend are described in detail in Section \ref{overcode}. The baseline interface was a single webpage with all student solutions concatenated in a random order into a flat list (Figure \ref{iterPowerEdXControl}, left). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We chose this design to emulate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This design emulates }\DIFaddend existing methods of reviewing solutions, and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{aims }\DIFaddend to draw out differences between browsing stacked and unstacked solutions. This is analogous to the ``flat'' interface chosen as a baseline for Basu et al.'s interface for grading clusters of short answers~\cite{basuDivideAndConquer}. Basu et al.'s assumption, that existing options for reviewing solutions are limited to going through solutions one-by-one, is backed by our pilot studies and interviews with teaching staff, and our own grading experiences. In fact, in edX programming MOOCs, teachers are not even provided with an interface for viewing all solutions at once\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; they }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. They }\DIFaddend can only look at one student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend solution at a time. If the solutions can be downloaded locally, some teachers may use \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{within-file search functions like the command line utility }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a search tool like }\DIFaddend \codevar{grep}. Our baseline allows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for search }\DIFaddend too, through the in-browser \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{find }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{Find}} \DIFaddend command. 

In the baseline, solutions appeared visually similar to those in the OverCode interface (boxed, syntax-highlighted code), but the solutions were \DIFdelbegin \emph{\DIFdel{raw}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{raw}\DIFaddend , in the sense that they were not normalized for whitespace or variable naming differences. As in the OverCode condition, subjects were able to use standard web-browser features, such as the within-page \DIFdelbegin \emph{\DIFdel{find}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{Find}} \DIFaddend action.

\DIFadd{Participants were recruited }\DIFaddend by reaching out to past and present programming course staff \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at our university}\DIFaddend , and advertising on an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{academic computer science research lab's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MIT CSAIL }\DIFaddend email list. These individuals were qualified to participate in our study because they met at least one of the following requirements: (1) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were current teaching staff of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have taught }\DIFaddend a computer science course (2) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{had }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend graded Python code before, or (3) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{had }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend significant Python programming experience, making them potential future teaching staff. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Subjects were offered \$20 to participate. 
}\DIFaddend 

Information about the subjects' backgrounds was collected during recruitment and again at the beginning of their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one hour }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one-hour }\DIFaddend in-lab user study session. 12 people (7 male) participated, with a mean age of 23.5 ($\sigma = 3.8$).

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Conditions}}

\DIFaddend Subjects performed the main task of browsing solutions and writing a class forum post twice, once in each interface condition, focusing on one of the three problems in our dataset (Section \ref{dataset}) each time. For each participant, the third remaining problem was used during training, to reduce learning effects when performing the two main tasks. The pairing and ordering of interface and problem conditions were fully counterbalanced, resulting in 12 total conditions. The twelve participants were randomly assigned to one of the 12 conditions, such that all conditions were tested.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Prompt}} \DIFaddend The experimenter began by reading the following prompt, to give the participant context for the tasks they would be performing:

\begin{quote}

We want to help TAs [teaching assistants] give feedback to students in programming classes at scale. For each of three problems, we have a large set of students' submissions ($> 1000$). 

All the submissions are correct, in terms of input and output behavior. We're going to ask you to browse the submissions and produce feedback for students in the class. You'll do this primarily in the form of a class forum post.
\end{quote}

To make the task more concrete, participants were given an example\footnote{Our example was drawn from the blog ``Practice Python: 30-minute weekly Python exercises for beginners,'' posted on Thursday, April 24, 2014, and titled ``SOLUTION Exercise 11: Check Primality and Functions.'' (\url{http://practicepython.blogspot.com})} of a class forum post that used examples taken from student solutions to explain different strategies for solving a Python problem. They were also given print-outs of the prompts for each of the three problems in our dataset, to reference when looking at solutions.

%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelend 

\DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Training}} \DIFaddend Given the subjects' extensive experience with web-browsers, training for the baseline interface was minimal. Prior to using the OverCode interface, subjects watched a 3-4 minute long training video demonstrating the features of OverCode, and were given an opportunity to become familiar with the interface and ask questions. The training session focused on the problem that would not be used in the main tasks, in order to avoid learning effects.

\DIFdelbegin \subsubsection{\DIFdel{Tasks}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{subsubsection}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Tasks}} \DIFaddend Subjects then performed the main tasks twice, once in each interface, focusing on a different programming problem each time. They were given a fixed amount of time to both read solutions and provide feedback, so \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we did not measure }\DIFdelend task completion times \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were not measured}\DIFaddend , but instead the quality of their experience in providing feedback to students at scale.

 \begin{itemize} 
\item {\it Feedback for Students} (15 minutes) Subjects were asked to write a class forum post on the good and bad ways students solved the problem.

This was a short-answer survey, where they wrote about what they liked, what they did not like, and what they would like to see in a future version of the interface.

From the surveys conducted after subjects completed each interface condition, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we found that }\DIFdelend subjects found stacking and the ability to rewrite code to be useful and enjoyable features of OverCode:
 \begin{itemize} 
\item \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFaddend Stacking is an awesome feature. Rewrite tool is fantastic. Done feature is very rewarding--feels much less overwhelming. "Lines that appear in x submissions" also awesome.\DIFaddbegin }
\DIFaddend 

\item \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFaddend Really liked the clever approach for variable normalization. Also liked the fact that stacks showed numbers, so I'd know I'm focusing on the highest-impact submissions. Impressed by the rewrite ability... it cut down on work so much!\DIFaddbegin }
\DIFaddend 

\item \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFaddend I liked having solutions collapsed (not having to deal with variable names, etc), and having rules to allow me to collapse even further. This made it easy to see the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"plurality" }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``plurality'' }\DIFaddend of solutions right away; I spent most of the time looking at the solutions that only had a few instances.\DIFaddbegin }
\DIFaddend  \end{itemize} 

When asked for suggestions, participants gave many suggestions on stacks, filtering, and rewrite rules, such as:
 \begin{itemize} 
\begin{comment}
\item Augment the stacks with a representation of the output of the code in that stack, since the autograder can consider more than one particular output ``correct.'' 
\end{comment}
\item Enable the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{user }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher }\DIFaddend to change the main stack that is being compared against the others.
\item Suggest possible rewrite rules, based on what the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{user }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher }\DIFaddend has already written, and will not affect the answers on the test case.
\item Create a filter that shows all stacks that do {\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \emph %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \it \DIFaddend not} have a particular statement.
 \end{itemize} 

For both the OverCode and baseline interfaces, the feedback generated about \codevar{iterPower}, \codevar{hangman}, and \codevar{compDeriv} solutions fell into several common themes. One kind of feedback suggested new language features, such as using \codevar{*=} or the keyword \codevar{in}. Another theme identified inefficient, redundant, and convoluted control flow, such as repeated statements and unnecessary statements and variables. It was not always clear what the misconception was, though, as one participant wrote, \textit{``The double iterator solution surely shows some lack of grasp of power of for loop, or range, or something.''} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Participants' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Participant }\DIFaddend feedback included comments on the relative goodness of different correct solutions in the dataset. This was a more holistic look at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend solutions as they varied along the dimensions of conciseness, clarity, and efficiency previously described.

Study participants found both noteworthy correct solutions and solutions they considered incorrect, despite passing the autograder. One participant learned a new Python function, \codevar{enumerate}, while looking at a solution that used it. The participant wrote, \textit{``Cool, but uncalled for. I had to look it up :]. Use, but with comment.''} Participants also found recursive \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman} solutions, which they found noteworthy. For what should have been an iterative \codevar{iterPower} function, the fact that this recursive solution was considered correct by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{unit-test-based }\DIFdelend autograder was considered an autograder bug by some participants. Using the built-in Python exponentiation operator \codevar{**} was also considered correct by the autograder, even though it subverted the point of the assignment. It was also noted as an autograder bug by some participants who found it.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Task}} \DIFaddend The coverage study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend task consisted of a more constrained feedback task. Given 15 minutes with either the OverCode or baseline interface, subjects were asked to fill out a table, identifying the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{five }\DIFaddend most frequent strategies used by students to solve the problem. For each strategy they identified, they were asked to fill in the following fields in the table:
 \begin{itemize} 
\item A code example taken from the solution or stack.
\item The identifier of the solution or stack.
\item A short (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one }\DIFaddend sentence) annotation of what was good or bad about the strategy.
\item Their confidence, on a scale of 1-7, that the strategy frequently occurred in the student solutions.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{H3: Feedback coverage}} \DIFaddend Each subject reported on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{five }\DIFaddend most frequent strategies in a set of solutions, by copying both a code example and the identifier of the solution (baseline) or stack (OverCode) that it came from. We define \emph{feedback coverage} as the number of students for which the quoted code is relevant, in the sense that they wrote the same lines of code, ignoring differences in whitespace or variable names. We computed the coverage for each example using the following process:
 \begin{itemize} 
\item Reduce the quoted code down to only the lines referred to in the annotation. Often, the subject's annotation would focus on a specific feature of the quoted code, which sometimes had additional lines that were unrelated to the subject's feedback. For example, comments about iterating over a range function, while also quoting the contents of the for loop. This step meant we would be calculating the coverage of a more general (smaller) set of lines.

\item Find the source stack that the quoted code comes from. This is trivial in the OverCode condition, where the stack ID is included in the subject's post. In the baseline, we used the solution ID included in the subject's post to find the stack that it was merged into by the backend pipeline.

\item Find the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend version of each quoted line. The quoted lines of code may be raw code if they come from the baseline condition. By comparing the quoted code with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend code of its source stack, we found the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend version of each line, with variable names and whitespace normalized.

\item Find the raw solutions that include the set of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend lines, using a map from stacks to raw solutions provided by the backend pipeline.

When giving feedback on the \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman} problems, there was not a statistically significant difference in the feedback coverage between interface conditions. However, on \codevar{compDeriv}, the problem with the most complex solutions, subjects using OverCode were able to achieve significantly more coverage of student solutions than when using the baseline interface (Mann--Whitney U = 0, n1 = n2 = 4, p< 0.05).

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Usage and Usefulness of Interface Features}} \DIFaddend In the second part of the post-study survey, participants rated their agreement with statements about the helpfulness of various interface features on a 7-point Likert scale. There were only two features to ask about in the baseline interface (in-browser find and viewing raw solutions), which were mixed in with statements about features in the OverCode interface. The OverCode feature of stacking equivalent solutions was found more helpful than the baseline \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend features of in-browser find (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{W=41, Z=2.07, p<0.05, r=0.60}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W=41, Z=2.07, p<0.05, r=0.60$}\DIFaddend ) and viewing raw \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend solutions, comments included (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{W=45, Z=2.87,p<0.005,r=0.83}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W=45, Z=2.87, p<0.005, r=0.83$}\DIFaddend ).

\end{figure}

In addition to logging \codevar{read} events, we also recorded usage of interface features, such as creating rewrite rules and filtering stacks. A common usage strategy was to read through the stacks linearly and mark them as \codevar{read}, starting with the largest reference stack, then rewrite trivial variations in expressions to merge smaller \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{behaviorally-equivalent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{behaviorally equivalent }\DIFaddend stacks into the largest stack. Stack filtering (Figure~\ref{linefilter}) was sometimes used to review solutions that contained a particularly conspicuous line\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend e.g.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend a recursive call to solve \codevar{iterPower} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend or an extremely long expression\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)}\DIFdelend . The filter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{panel }\DIFaddend frequency slider (Figure~\ref{linefilter}a) and the variable legend (Figure~\ref{afterrewrite}b) were scarcely used.

All subjects wrote at least two rewrite rules, often causing stacks to merge that only differed in some trivial way, like reordering operands in multiplication statements\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend e.g.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend \codevar{result = result*base} vs. \codevar{result = base*result}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)}\DIFdelend . Some rewrite rules merged Python expressions that behaved similarly but differed in their verbosity\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend e.g.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend \codevar{for i in range(0, exp)} vs. \codevar{for i in range(exp)}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) - variations that might }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.

\DIFaddend \section{Discussion}

Our three-part evaluation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode }\DIFaddend backend and user interface demonstrates its usability and usefulness in a realistic teaching scenario. Given that we focused on the first three weeks of an introductory Python programming course, our evaluation is limited to single functions, whose most common solutions were less than ten lines long. Some of these functions were recursive, while most were iterative. Variables were generally limited to booleans, integers, strings, and lists of these basic data types. All solutions had already passed the autograder tests, and study participants still found solutions that suggested \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend misconceptions or knowledge gaps. Future work will address more complex algorithms and data types.

\DIFdelbegin \subsection{\DIFdel{Read coverage}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{subsection}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Read coverage}}
\DIFaddend First, we observed that subjects were able to effectively read less in order to cover more ground (H1, read coverage). This is expected, because in OverCode each read stack represented tens or hundreds of raw solutions, while there was only a 1-to-1 mapping between read solutions and raw solutions in the baseline condition. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's backend makes it possible to produce a single cleaned piece of code that represents }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The OverCode backend produces platonic solutions that represent }\DIFaddend many raw solutions, reducing the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normally high }\DIFdelend cognitive load of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mentally }\DIFaddend processing all the raw solutions, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{including }\DIFaddend their variation in formatting and variable naming.

Figure \ref{readCoverage}(a) shows that in some cases, subjects were able to read nearly as many (\codevar{hangman}) or more (\codevar{iterPower}) function definitions in the baseline as in OverCode. In the case of \codevar{iterPower}, the raw solutions are repetitive because of the simplicity of the problem and the relatively small amounts of variation demonstrated by student solutions. This can explain the subjects' ability to move quickly through the set of solutions, reading as many as 90 solutions in 15 minutes.

Figure \ref{readCoverage}(b) shows the effective number of raw solutions read, when accounting for the number of solutions represented by each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stack }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution read }\DIFaddend in the OverCode condition. In the case of \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \codevar%%%
\DIFdel{(iterPower)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \codevar{iterPower}\DIFaddend , subjects can say they have effectively read more than 30\% of student solutions after reading the first stack. A similar statement can be made for \codevar{hangman}, where the largest stack \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{represents }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{includes }\DIFaddend roughly 10\% of solutions. In the case of \codevar{compDeriv}, the small size of its largest stack (22 out of 1433 raw solutions) means that the curve is less steep, but the use of rewrite rules (avg. 4.5 rules written per \codevar{compDeriv} subject) enabled subjects to cover over 10x the solutions covered by subjects in the baseline condition.

\DIFdelbegin \subsection{\DIFdel{Feedback coverage}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{subsection}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Feedback coverage}}
\DIFaddend We also found that subjects' feedback on solutions for the \codevar{compDeriv} problem had significantly higher coverage when produced using OverCode than with the baseline, but that this was not the case for the \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman} problems. \codevar{compDeriv} was a significantly more complicated problem than both \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman}, meaning that there was a greater amount of variation between student solutions. This high variation meant that any one piece of feedback might not be relevant to many raw solutions, unless it was produced after viewing the solution space as stacks and creating rewrite rules to simplify the space into larger, more representative stacks. Conversely, the simple nature of \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman} meant that there was less variation in student solutions. Therefore, regardless of whether the subject was using the OverCode or baseline condition, there was a higher likelihood that they would stumble across a solution that had frequently occurring lines of code, and the feedback coverage for these problems became comparable between the two problems.

\DIFdelbegin \subsection{\DIFdel{Perceived coverage}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{subsection}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Perceived coverage}}
\DIFaddend In addition to the actual read and feedback coverage that subjects achieved, an important finding was that (i) subjects felt they had developed a better high-level understanding of student solutions and (ii) subjects stated they were more confident that identified strategies were frequent issues in the dataset. While a low self-reported confidence score did not necessarily correlate with low feedback coverage, these results suggest that OverCode enables the teacher to gauge the impact that their feedback will have.

\section{\DIFadd{GroverCode: OverCode for Grading}}\label{sec:grover}

\DIFadd{While understanding the contents of thousands of correct student solutions can be helpful in both residential and online contexts, another application of the OverCode pipeline and interface is supporting the hand-grading of introductory Python programming exam solutions, only some of which are correct. Incorrect solutions are defined as those that do not pass at least one test case in }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode pipeline has been modified in several ways.
It has been split into two phases: solution preprocessing and batch processing. During preprocessing, each solution's formatting is standardized and all comments are removed.
It is then executed on one or more test cases, which makes the resulting canonicalization more robust to any individual poorly chosen test case.
The full program trace and output is recorded for every test case. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher-designed test suite.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This logging of solution execution can be one of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Hand-reviewing solutions is necessary because test suites can unfairly penalize some students and award undeserved credit to others. For example, a single typo in an otherwise well-written solution can cause it to fail all the test cases and receive no credit. Conversely, a solution that subverts the purpose of the assignment can still receive credit by returning the expected answer to some or all of the test cases.
}

\DIFadd{For the staff of 6.0001, the residential introductory Python programming course at MIT, this can be one of the most time-consuming and exhausting parts of teaching the course. It can take a full workday for the entire staff of eight to ten teachers to sit in a room and review several hundred student solutions by hand in order to assign a single numerical grade to each solution.
}

\DIFadd{Stacey Terman, in partial fulfilment of her Master's of Engineering, worked with me to extend OverCode to a new domain, i.e., incorrect solutions, and a new task, i.e., grading hundreds of incorrect solutions by hand. This new version of OverCode for grading is referred to as GroverCode. GroverCode was iteratively designed and evaluated as a grading tool through two live deployments during the Spring 2016 6.0001 staff exam grading sessions. The following tables, figures, and code samples generated from those deployments are adapted with permission from Stacey Terman's thesis.
}

\DIFadd{GroverCode contains two main technical contributions: a modified pipeline that can normalize both correct and incorrect solutions and an interface designed for grading. Just as the original pipeline used variable behavior to normalize variable names, the modified pipeline uses variable behavior and the syntax of statements containing each variable to normalize variable names in solutions that are not correct. This comes from the insight that a variable in an incorrect solution can be semantically equivalent to a variable in a correct solution but still behave differently. It can behave differently due to a bug in a line of code that directly modifies its value or a bug in a line of code that affects the behavior of another variable that it depends on. Since many of the exam solutions are incorrect and do not get clustered together, }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{longer steps in the OverCode analysis pipeline, so preprocessing occurs once were solution and is saved in its own pickle file. New solutionscan be preprocessed once, without affecting previously preprocessed solutions.
Batch processing takes, as input, all the existing preprocessed results and canonializes variable names. This must occur as a batch operation because variable renaming depends on the behaviorand name of every variable in every solution }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{new user interface organizes solutions according to their behavior on test cases and compositional similarity to each other, rather than by cluster size.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{User Interface}}

\DIFadd{The GroverCode interface, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:whole_interface}, has several additions and distinctions from the OverCode interface. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:correct_and_incorrect_stacks}, both correct solutions and incorrect solutions are displayed, differentiable by their varied background colors and red X's next to every failed test}\DIFaddend . \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To better explain each test failure, the solution's differing actual and expected outputs are also displayed. A rubric, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rubric}, is iteratively developed by the grading staff as they grade.

\DIFadd{The panel of progress indicators and filters, shown on the left side of Figure~\ref{fig:whole_interface}, helps teachers understand the distribution of solution behavior on test cases, track their grading progress, and grade sets of solutions that fail the same test cases one at a time. The rows of aligned sequences of green checks and red dashes represent error vectors, i.e., the pass/fail results with respect to the ordered list of teacher-specified test cases. The checkbox next to each error vector allows the teacher to selectively view subsets of solutions based on the particular tests they pass and fail. Solutions with the same error vectors may include similar mistakes. 
}

\DIFadd{Like OverCode, GroverCode groups correct solutions into stacks. Grades are propagated to all the solutions in a stack. Incorrect solutions were not also grouped into stacks because the stacking process was new and experimental for field deployment in an actual grading session. GroverCode still normalized all solutions, both correct and incorrect.
}

\DIFadd{The grading performed by the 6.0001 staff was intellectually demanding. For example, many staff members attempted to correct incorrect solutions by hand to better undertstand how far off the student was from a correct answer. When raw solutions are shown in random order, one solution may have a different approach, behavior, and appearance from the next. The transition from grading one solution to the next can mean starting from scratch. In an attempt to minimize the cognitive load of switching from one solution to the next, the GroverCode user interface includes the following features:
} \begin{itemize} 
\item \DIFadd{Horizontally aligned solutions for side-by-side comparison
}\item \DIFadd{Easy filtering of solutions by input-output behavior, i.e., their error vectors
}\item \DIFadd{Normalized variable names
}\item \DIFadd{Solutions ordered to minimize the distance between adjacent solutions with respect to a custom similarity metric defined in Stacey Terman's Master's of Engineering thesis~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{staceythesis}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\item \DIFadd{Highlighted lines of code in each solution which differ from the previous solution in the horizontal list
} \end{itemize} 

\DIFadd{In OverCode, }\DIFaddend a single-line difference between two solutions could, by affecting a variable's behavior, cause the variable renaming process to propagate that difference as a variable name change throughout all the lines that mention the affected variable. This non-locality of difference made it harder to spot in the user interface where the actual syntactic difference between two \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions was. As a result, stacks are rendered in the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GroverCode }\DIFaddend user interface slightly differently. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Now, even if the canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Even if the normalized }\DIFaddend variable names are different between two syntactically identical lines of code in two different stacks, if the variables take on the same sequence of values {\it just within that line of code}, it will not be highlighted as different in the user interface. Only the line with the syntactic difference will be highlighted.


\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In order to implement this , the modified }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Implementation}}\DIFadd{~}\label{subsec:grovercodepipeline}

\DIFadd{The GroverCode implementation is a modification of the OverCode pipeline. Solutions which return an expected output for all test cases during the preprocessing step are categorized as correct, and all other solutions, having failed at least one test case, are categorized as incorrect. Correct solutions are normalized by the same process as was used in the original OverCode. 
}

\DIFadd{In the original OverCode pipeline for correct solutions, variable behavior is assumed to hold enough semantic information to be the sole basis on which variable names are normalized. GroverCode applies this rule to incorrect solutions as well, but only for variables whose behavior matches a common variable in the correct solutions. This step may be error prone. Incorrect solutions are known to be wrong with respect to input-output behavior, the behavior of the variables within them is suspect too, even if it happens to match a common variable in a correct solution. %DIF > if a variable in an incorrect solution has the same behavior as a common variable in the correct solutions, GroverCode will rename the variable in the incorrect solution so it matches the common variable's name in the correct solutions.
}

%DIF > However, this renaming strategy may change in future versions of GroverCode because, 

\DIFadd{In incorrect solutions, syntax, e.g., the operations applied to a variable, may be more helpful for normalizing variable names than behavior. For example, in an incorrect solution, a variable $i$ may be operated or depended on exactly the same way as a common variable in a correct solution. However, if an error somewhere else in the solution causes $i$ to behave differently, the original method of identifying common variables will be thrown off. %DIF > Based on this example, variables in incorrect solutions that are not already renamed based on behavior are renamed based on syntax.
}

\DIFadd{The OverCode pipeline is modified for GroverCode to capture this syntactic information. The modified }\DIFaddend pipeline examines the program trace collected during preprocessing and the AST for each solution and compiles the following information for each line of code in each solution:
 \begin{enumerate} 
\item a template, i.e., the line of code with variables replaced by blanks, e.g., \texttt{\underline{\hspace{1em}} += 1} and \texttt{for \underline{\hspace{1em}} in range(\underline{\hspace{1em}}):}
\item an ordered list of the common \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variables' behavior and their canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variable behaviors and their normalized }\DIFaddend names corresponding to each blank in the line, e.g., the blank in \texttt{\underline{\hspace{1em}} += 1} can be associated with one of several common variables, depending on the rest of the solution
\item an ordered list of the sequences of values each blanked-out variable in the line took on during execution, e.g., the first blank in \texttt{for \underline{\hspace{1em}} in range(\underline{\hspace{1em}}):} might iterate through \texttt{1,2,3} while, with each visitation of this line during execution, the second blank stays constant at \texttt{[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]}
 \end{enumerate} 
Items 1 and 2 in this list together contain the information in the original \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend lines in OverCode and information about the line's syntax, regardless of the variables \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{' }\DIFdelend identities. Items 1 and 3 capture the information necessary to tell what the variable behavior is just within that one line and whether two lines in two different stacks will be highlighted as different from each other. %DIF <  is, without being affected a very similar concept, except it is more robust to non-local variations in variable behavior.

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Field Deployment}}

\DIFadd{Approximately two hundred students were enrolled in 6.0001, and nine instructors used GroverCode to grade nearly all student solutions. %DIF > Seven programming problems of a variety of difficulties were graded over the course of these two sessions.
The GroverCode analysis pipeline was run on both the midterm and final exam problems from the Spring 2016 semester of 6.0001, which had approximately 200 students enrolled. These exams contained seven programming problems in total, and between 133 and 189 solutions per problem made it through the analysis pipeline to be displayed in the user interface. The midterm problem prompts were:
} \begin{itemize} 
\item \texttt{\DIFadd{power}} \DIFadd{(q4): Write a recursive function to calculate the exponential }\texttt{\DIFadd{base}} \DIFadd{to the power }\texttt{\DIFadd{exp}}\DIFadd{.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{give\_and\_take}} \DIFadd{(q5): Given a dictionary }\texttt{\DIFadd{d}} \DIFadd{and a list }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, return a new dictionary that contains the keys of }\texttt{\DIFadd{d}}\DIFadd{. Map each key to its value in }\texttt{\DIFadd{d}} \DIFadd{plus one if the key is contained in }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, and its value in d minus one if the key is not contained in }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{closest\_power}} \DIFadd{(q6): Given an integer base and a target integer }\texttt{\DIFadd{num}}\DIFadd{, find the integer exponent that minimizes the difference between }\DIFaddend \texttt{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{float}%DIFDELCMD < }s %%%
\DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{num}} \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend \texttt{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{int}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{base}\DIFaddend } \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{s can cause problems for novice Python students, such as accidental integer division, }\texttt{\DIFdel{1}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to the power of exponent, choosing the smaller exponent in the case of a tie.
} \end{itemize} 
\DIFadd{The final problem prompts were:
} \begin{itemize} 
\item \texttt{\DIFadd{deep\_reverse}} \DIFadd{(q4): Write a function that takes a list of lists of integers }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, and reverses }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}} \DIFadd{and each element of }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}} \DIFadd{in place.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{applyF\_filterG}} \DIFadd{(q5): Write a function that takes three arguments: a list of integers }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, a function }\texttt{\DIFadd{f}} \DIFadd{that takes an integer and returns an integer, and a function }\DIFaddend \texttt{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1.0}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{g}\DIFaddend } \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are considered to be different values, and therefore the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that takes an integer and returns a boolean. Remove elements from }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}} \DIFadd{such that for each remaining element }\texttt{\DIFadd{i}}\DIFadd{, }\texttt{\DIFadd{f(g(i))}} \DIFadd{returns }\texttt{\DIFadd{True}}\DIFadd{. Return the largest element of the mutated list, or -1 if the list is empty after mutation.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{MITCampus}} \DIFadd{(q6): Given the definitions of two classes: }\texttt{\DIFadd{Location}}\DIFadd{, which represents a two-dimensional coordinate point, and }\texttt{\DIFadd{Campus}}\DIFadd{, which represents a college campus centered at a particular }\texttt{\DIFadd{Location}}\DIFadd{, fill in several methods in the }\DIFaddend \texttt{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{result}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MITCampus}\DIFaddend } \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variables in each }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{class, a subclass of }\texttt{\DIFadd{Campus}} \DIFadd{that represents a college campus with tents at various }\texttt{\DIFadd{Locations}}\DIFadd{.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{longest\_run}} \DIFadd{(q7): Write a function that takes a list of integers }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, finds the longest run of either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing integers in }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, and returns the sum of this run.
} \end{itemize} 
\DIFadd{For each problem processed during the field deployments, an example of a staff-written correct solution is included in the Appendix.
}

\DIFadd{Using the GroverCode user interface, nine instructors, including one lecturer and eight teaching assistants (TAs) graded these solutions as part of their official grading responsibilities. Stacey Terman, the Master's of Engineering student who implemented most of GroverCode, was one of these TAs. Solutions that did not successfully pass through the pipeline were graded by hand afterwards. TA grading events, e.g., adding or applying rubric items and point values to solutions, were logged. The observer (the author of this thesis) took extensive notes during each day-long grading session to capture spontaneous feature requests as well as bugs and complaints.

\DIFadd{GroverCode was particularly appreciated on simpler problems where correct solutions were clustered together and graded by a single action. Under these conditions, the clustering capability GroverCode inherits from OverCode amplified teacher effort.
}

\DIFadd{Variable renaming was, for simpler programming problems, an invisible and possibly slightly confusing helping hand. One grader remarked, out loud: ``Why is everyone naming their iterator variable `i'?'' at which point he had to be reminded of the variable renaming process. 
}

\DIFadd{When applied to more complex solutions, the normalization process was at times more harmful than helpful for teacher comprehension. As solutions became more varied and structurally complex, graders started toggling off normalization because the renaming of variables, removal of comments, and formatting standardization was removing clues they needed in order to understand student intent.
}

\DIFadd{The feature for grouping solutions based on their behavior on test cases was appreciated regardless of solution complexity. While it was difficult to get direct feedback on the helpfulness of pair-wise difference highlighting and optimized solution ordering, graders heavily used and appreciated the ability to filter and grade solutions one error vector at a time. At least one grader remarked aloud that it seemed like many of the solution with the same error vector made similar mistakes. Therefore filtering by error vector may have been one of the stronger contributors to any hypothetical decreased cognitive load due to using GroverCode over the status quo of random assignment to solutions in a CSV file}\DIFaddend .

Unfortunately, }\DIFaddend hand-grading \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{student code for substance and style. Unfortunately, those methods are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend labor intensive, potentially inconsistent across graders, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{does }\DIFaddend not scale to the sizes associated with Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The scaling difficulty is particularly important when considering that  some residential course enrollments at prominent universities, like }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Residential courses are also becoming massive. For example, }\DIFaddend UC Berkeley's \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{introduction to programming, }\DIFaddend CS61A, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are rising above the thousand-student mark }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has had more than a thousand students enrolled per semester~}\DIFaddend \cite{biggestClass}. Some Computer Science teachers, such as MIT's John Guttag and Ana Bell, are simultaneously teaching hundreds of students in residential programming courses and thousands of online students in MOOC versions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of their courses}\DIFaddend .

Variable naming is a specific, important aspect of writing readable, maintainable code, and many teachers want to give feedback on it. The quality of a name is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{most easily }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{best }\DIFaddend judged when its role within the surrounding code is known. However, at scale, teachers cannot read every solution. Programming education at scale opens up new challenges for processing and presenting thousands of solutions so that teachers can more easily view them. Teachers also cannot write comments on each solution. This difficulty motivates the creation of tools that help teachers give customized feedback\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to subsets of students for whom that feedback is relevant}\DIFdelend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We introduce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter introduces }\DIFaddend Foobaz, a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{user interface }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{system }\DIFaddend for giving tailored feedback on student variable names at scale. Foobaz enables teachers to explore and comment on the quality of student-chosen variable names, given the role the variables play in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' code (see Figure \ref{fig:figure2})}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student solutions}\DIFaddend . A variable's \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{role }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFadd{role}} \DIFaddend is a function of the sequence of values that the variable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contains }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{takes on }\DIFaddend during program execution. The variety of student-chosen variable names for each role makes evaluating every one prohibitive. Using Foobaz, the teacher can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{label }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFadd{label}} \DIFaddend a small subset of good and bad names for each role \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with judgments like ``too short'' or ``misleading.'' Figure \ref{fig:figure2} shows the teacher interface.
}\DIFaddend

\caption{\DIFaddFL{The Foobaz teacher interface. The teacher is presented with a scrollable list of normalized solutions, each followed by a table of student-chosen variable names. Some names shown here have been labeled by the teacher as ``misleading or vague,'' ``too short,'' or ``fine.''}}
\DIFaddFL{~}\label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure*}

\DIFaddend Foobaz then uses these labeled variable names to create pedagogically valuable active learning exercises in the format of multiple choice quizzes. These quizzes are a form of feedback for many more students than just those whose variable names receive a teacher \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s label. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{label.

This moves the feedback closer to the ideals described by variation theory.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Foobaz personalizes teacher quizzes for each student, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Quizzes are personalized by Foobaz }\DIFaddend so that students \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can }\DIFdelend consider good and bad names for variables \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that exist }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with the same role }\DIFaddend in their own solutions. Personalized quizzes render the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{student's original code submission }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{original student solution }\DIFaddend with a specific variable replaced by an arbitrary symbol. The quiz presents the student with several variable names as candidate replacements for the symbol, one of which may be the student's original choice. The student selects appropriate labels for the variable names before checking their labels against teacher labels\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and comments}\DIFdelend .

In two user studies, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we demonstrate }\DIFdelend the capabilities and workflow enabled by this novel interface \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for both teachers and students.

\DIFaddend \section{User Interface}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Consider an introductory programming MOOC where thousands }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Thousands }\DIFaddend of students submit correct solutions to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a programming exercise. Imagine that many }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the same programming problem in MOOCs and massive residential courses. Many }\DIFaddend of these solutions include \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a variable that takes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variables that take }\DIFaddend on the same sequence of values \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, like a running sum of the elements in an input argument. While most students decide to name this variable $result$, others decide to give it obscure or less descriptive names like $p$, $val1$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{when run on the same test cases. Table~\ref{examplecommonvars} in Chapter~\ref{chapter:overcode} shows these common variables, the names students most commonly gave them, and some of the less common names for the same variables}\DIFaddend .

The quality of a variable's name is most easily judged when the teacher understands its algorithmic role and relationship to other variable names within the surrounding code. At scale, this can be difficult and frustrating, because while variable roles can be repetitive across many solutions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, their names can be unpredictable and vary greatly in quality, }\DIFaddend e.g., \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{result}}\DIFadd{, }\texttt{\DIFadd{val1}}\DIFadd{, or }\texttt{\DIFadd{s}} \DIFadd{as names for }\DIFaddend a particular running sum\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{), their names can be unpredictable ($result$, $val1$, $s$)}\DIFdelend . Instead of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{browsing student submissions in a linear fashion, it would be better if the teacher }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{giving feedback on variable names by browsing student solutions one by one, teachers }\DIFaddend could provide feedback on the basis of variable roles.

In Foobaz, teachers can browse \emph{stacks} of student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{submissions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solutions represented by platonic solutions}\DIFaddend . A stack is a set of solutions whose code is identical after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normalizing formattingand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{standardizing formatting, normalizing }\DIFaddend variable names, removing comments, and ignoring the exact order of statements. Within a stack, the teacher can browse the different sets of variable names that students chose, label some of them as, e.g., ``too short'' or ``misleading,'' and add comments. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Teacher }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Foobaz uses teacher }\DIFaddend labels and comments \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are used }\DIFdelend to provide students with tailored feedback in the form of personalized quizzes on variable names. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{By providing feedback on only a few variable names , personalized quizzes are generated that are potentially relevant to thousands of students. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A teacher only needs to label a few student-chosen names for the same variable role. Foobaz will then generate a quiz and every student whose solution contains that variable role can receive a personalized form of that quiz. %DIF > This quiz may be relevant to a significant fraction of students who submitted solutions.
}

%DIF > By providing feedback on only a few variable names, personalized quizzes are generated that are potentially relevant to thousands of students. 
\DIFaddend Foobaz is distinct from powergrading systems\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{: instead }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Instead }\DIFaddend of grading as many names as possible, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the system produces personalized quizzes that have excellent examples }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers work with Foobaz to strategically label a small subset }\DIFaddend of good and bad \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variable names students would not otherwise get to see and learn from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{examples. If powergrading were possible, students might get feedback on their own variable name choices, but with Foobaz, they can learn from others' good and bad choices}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdel{and }\emph{\DIFdel{common variables}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{. These groupings are automatically produced by the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend OverCode analysis pipeline \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which starts by executing each student 's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{executes each student }\DIFaddend solution on a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{single }\DIFdelend test case and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tracking }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tracks }\DIFaddend the sequences of values that variables take on. Common variables are identified as those that behave the same way\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend i.e., take on the same sequence of values\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend across multiple solutions. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Raw solutions are then normalized by renaming instances of common variables with their most popular names, as well as removing comments and extra whitespace. Normalized solutions that have the same set of lines can be grouped together into a }\emph{\DIFdel{stack}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{, with a single representative on top for the teacher to read}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{After executing every solution, the OverCode pipeline groups solutions into stacks of similar solutions. Each stack is represented by a single platonic solution. In the Foobaz teacher view, the teacher browses the platonic solutions and annotates the quality of variable names for common variables}\DIFaddend . 

The stacking performed by the system directly reduces the number of implementations that a teacher needs to analyze in order to provide feedback to the majority of the class. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore, Foobaz is sensitive to }\emph{\DIFdel{variable roles}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{, meaning that variables that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Variables that }\DIFaddend behave the same across different stacks are linked together as a single common variable. The result is that feedback provided for a variable in one stack is propagated to variables that play out the same behavior in \emph{other} stacks.

\subsection{Rating Variable Names}

The Foobaz interface lets the teacher rate variable names in the context of their role in the program. Figure \ref{fig:figure2} shows the teacher \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend view while they perform this task. 

The teacher is presented with a scrollable list of stacks. Each stack is represented as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normalized stack code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a platonic solution }\DIFaddend followed by a table of alternative variable names. Since some of the tables are taller than the screen, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normalized stack code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution }\DIFaddend is pinned to the screen in such a way that it remains visible until the next stack is scrolled into view.

Each column of the table represents the common variables occurring in the stack, where each common variable's most popular name serves as the column header. Each row of the table represents a unique set of variable names used in a solution\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(e. g., $secretWord$, $lettersGuessed$, $guessedWord$, $char$)}\DIFdelend . \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For example, }\texttt{\DIFadd{secretWord}}\DIFadd{, }\texttt{\DIFadd{lettersGuessed}}\DIFadd{, }\texttt{\DIFadd{guessedWord}}\DIFadd{, and }\texttt{\DIFadd{char}} \DIFadd{are all the names that were used in one particular raw solution. }\DIFaddend We show \emph{sets} of variable name choices, rather than independent columns of variable names, because we found in early pilot testing that variable names can at times make more sense when seen as a group, rather than as individual naming decisions. This helps give teachers the context and confidence to assign quality judgments.

As the teacher brushes over the names of a common variable in the table, its occurrences in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normalized code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution }\DIFaddend are highlighted, so they can develop an understanding of the variable's role in the solution. The teacher can then go down the list of student-chosen names, rating as many of them as they desire using three different labels: ``misleading or vague,'' ``too short,'' or ``fine.'' These labels were based on early pilot testing with beginner programmers but future iterations of Foobaz may support teacher-added labels. Next to each name, they can also see how frequently it was given to that common variable across all solutions in the dataset, and can sort the entire table by this frequency. In order to draw teachers' attention to student-chosen variable names, variables with names that match one of given parameter names provided with the homework prompt are greyed out. The long tail of infrequently used names can be a place where both the best and worst examples of names can be found.

It is important to note that each common variable is likely to occur in multiple stacks. When the teacher selects a particular name, or set of names, for a common variable, occurrences in other stacks are highlighted as well. When they assign a label to a name, the label is propagated to all uses of the name for that common variable, across all the stacks. This has the effect of ``filling down'' the teacher \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend annotations. As teachers scroll down, they see that much of their feedback has been propagated for them, letting them focus on the remaining best and worst examples they might find. 

A progress bar at the top of the page indicates the coverage of their feedback across all variable names. Since teachers were motivated by the progress bar to maximize their coverage, we provided a button which would select and scroll into view the next most popular, yet unlabeled name for a common variable. Also included to maximize efficiency, the interface supports navigation through the variable names in the table using arrow keys. Teachers can also press hotkeys to rate variables instead of clicking on one of the three quality judgments, e.g., press \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$2$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{2}} \DIFaddend to rate a variable name as ``too short.''

\subsection{Making Quizzes}

Each quiz is an active learning exercise that asks the student to think about good and bad names for a common variable. Quizzes begin by showing a solution with that common variable's name replaced by an arbitrary symbol everywhere it occurs. In a personalized quiz, the solution is the student's own, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure4}. The quiz presents the student with several variable names as candidate replacements for the symbol, one of which may be the student's original choice. The student labels these names before checking their labels against the teacher's. If a student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend solution includes a particular common variable, then that student can receive a personalized version of the quiz about that variable.

As teachers rate variables by attaching labels to them, quizzes are created with these names as their good and bad examples. Using the Toggle Quiz Preview button, teachers can see a preview of the quizzes (Figure \ref{fig:figure3}) alongside the scrollable list of stacks and watch the quizzes grow as they rate more names. They can hide the quiz preview to reduce visual clutter while they explore all the stacks, common variables, and interesting alternative names.

If two different common variables perform the same conceptual role in student solutions but do not go through the exact same sequence of values, then the teacher can use the ``Merge'' button to combine the quizzes about each common variable into a single quiz. This quiz becomes relevant to students who have either common variable in their own solution and can be sent out to both groups.

Ultimately, the teachers' goal is to provide pedagogically valuable personalized quizzes to as many of the hundreds or thousands of students in the course as possible. Analogous to the progress bar for variable names, the quiz preview pane includes a progress bar for the number of stacks of solutions that will receive at least one quiz. Like the previously discussed button for selecting the next most popular unlabeled name, the quiz preview pane also includes a button for jumping to the next largest stack of student solutions that do not yet have any quizzes. If the teacher deems one of their automatically populated quizzes to be not pedagogically valuable, then they can uncheck the option to send that quiz back to students. To provide more illustrative examples that might not have been produced in student solutions, teachers can add their own custom good and bad variable name examples and write explanations in the comment field associated with each alternative name.

\section{Evaluation}

We evaluate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Foobaz's teacher and student-facing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Foobaz teacher and student }\DIFaddend interfaces with two consecutive user studies, one for each population. In order to evaluate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Foobaz's scalability }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the scalability of Foobaz}\DIFaddend , the solutions seen by teachers were collected from MOOCs with thousands of students and a residential college class of several hundred students.

\subsection{Datasets}

We evaluated Foobaz on sets of correct solutions to four different programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercises}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problems}\DIFaddend , ranging in size from a couple hundred to several thousand solutions, collected from 6.00x, an introductory programming course in Python that was offered on edX in the fall of 2012, and 6.0001, a residential introductory programming course in Python offered at MIT in the fall of 2014 (see Figure \ref{solutioncounttable}). The four exercises, referred to here as \codevar{iterPower}, \codevar{hangman}, \codevar{dotProduct}, and \codevar{computeDerivative}, are representative of typical exercises that students solve in the early weeks of an introductory programming course. They have varying levels of complexity and ask students to perform loop computation over three fundamental Python data types, integers, strings, and lists.

%DIF > \textbf{Power-law Distribution of Names} 
%DIF > The approximate power-law-type distribution of stacks from the thousands of edX solutions has already been reported in prior work, such as Figure 12 in \cite{overcode}. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The distribution of unique combinations of variable names and behaviors does not differ significantly from a power-law distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for a difference between the best-fitting power-law distribution and each dataset all gave p-values of at least $0.44$ (i.e., not significantly different), with the best-fitting exponent of the distribution between $1.79$ and $2.13$. Within each stack, the names for any particular variable appear to follow the same distribution.
}

\DIFadd{There is no ground truth for which variable names are ``bad,'' but we can report the counts of variables that the teachers chose to label and the counts of unique names for the top common variables in each problem. In the 3875 }\codevar{iterPower} \DIFadd{solutions, there were 179 different names given to a variable representing the base being exponentiated and 64 different names for a variable representing the exponent. In the 1393 }\codevar{computeDerivative} \DIFadd{solutions, there were 176 different names given for the variable containing the result and 39 different names for the most commonly used iterator variable. In the 1118 }\codevar{hangman} \DIFadd{solutions, there were 50 names given to the variable that iteratively takes on the characters of the secret word input argument and 99 names given to the variable containing the string most commonly returned by solutions as the answer.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection{Teacher Study}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The teacher study was designed to assess whether teachers could create variable name quizzes with the Foobaz teacher interface. If teachers could create quizzes, the study would measure how well those quizzes covered the student solutions in the dataset. These questions were answered by analyzing logs of each subject's activity while using Foobaz and their responses to survey questions about their experiences.
}

\DIFadd{The hour-long session contained a warm-up exercise, a Foobaz demonstration, and a session where subjects used Foobaz to create as many variable name quizzes for as many students as possible. }\DIFaddend During the initial briefing, teachers were informed that they would be looking at solutions that had already passed an autograder and instructed to focus only on variable names, ignoring other aspects of code style, structure, and correctness. Teachers \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were invited to look over a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{then attempt a warm-up exercise: composing variable name quizzes inspired by the variation in variable names they see in a baseline interface for viewing student solutions to problem $1$. They then watched a demonstration-based tutorial of Foobaz on student solutions to problem $2$, i.e., the training step. Finally they attempted to create variable name quizzes using the Foobaz interface for student solutions to problem $3$, i.e., the experimental condition. Over the course of the session, each teacher saw student solutions to three of the four possible problems, and counterbalancing was used to ensure that the same problems were not always being shown in the same interface. 
}

%DIF > \subsubsection{Warm-up}

\DIFadd{Before interacting with Foobaz, teachers worked on a control task. Teachers reviewed a }\DIFaddend page in a browser with all solutions concatenated in a random order into a flat list of boxed, syntax-highlighted code. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is the same baseline interface as was used in the OverCode Coverage Study. }\DIFaddend We chose this design as our baseline to emulate existing methods of reviewing student functions. 

Using this baseline interface, teachers were asked first to rate as many good and bad variable names as possible, with an eye toward maximizing coverage of names\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(Task Part 1). }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, i.e., Task Part 1. }\DIFaddend Next, the teachers were shown an example of a quiz and were asked to compose their own by listing variable names and labeling them as good or bad with whatever short descriptors and explanatory comments they wished\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(Task Part 2). }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, i.e., Task Part 2. }\DIFaddend Participants were given 5 minutes for each task, and then asked to fill out a survey about their experience. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend The answers to two of these surveys were lost so we only report survey results from 8 of the 10 participants. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)
}\DIFdelend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The survey questions included both free response and 7-point Likert scale survey questions (1 means strong disagreement and 7 means strong agreement). The free response questions were:
} \begin{enumerate}  
\item \DIFadd{``What did you like about this process of providing feedback on variable names?''
}\item \DIFadd{``What did you NOT like about this process of providing feedback on variable names?'' 
}\item \DIFadd{``What did you wish you could have or achieve during this process of providing feedback on variable names?'' 
}\item \DIFadd{``What, if anything, did you find in the data that surprised you?''
} \end{enumerate} 
\DIFadd{The 7-point Likert scale survey questions were:
} \begin{enumerate} 
\item \DIFadd{``This interface helped me provide feedback to many students.''
}\item \DIFadd{``The interface helped me develop a high-level view of students' variable naming skills.''
}\item \DIFadd{``I saw a large percentage of these students' variable names.''
}\item \DIFadd{``I was able to give specific, personalized feedback to many students.''
}\item \DIFadd{``The system amplified my effort.''
} \end{enumerate} 

%DIF > \subsubsection{Experimental Condition}

\DIFaddend Participants learned about the Foobaz interface by watching a tutorial video. This training process took between 10 and 15 minutes depending on the dataset shown in the video. Participants were encouraged to hold their questions to the end, and answer them by interacting with the interface. 

Participants performed both Task Part 1 and 2 on a third dataset of solutions in the Foobaz teacher interface. Participants were asked to spend 5 minutes to perform each task, though some decided to spend more time. They filled out the same \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{surveys }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{survey }\DIFaddend about their experience again, followed by a final survey \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{about which features of the Foobaz interface they found helpful}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with 7-point Likert scale questions about each Foobaz feature and Foobaz overall}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{Apparatus}

In all sessions, we used a laptop with a 15.4-inch 2880x1800 pixel Retina screen. All participants' interactions with the system were logged with timestamps\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{using Meteor collections}\DIFdelend .

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 10 participants (6 female) with ages between 20 and 29 ($\mu=23.1$, $\sigma=2.7$) through computer science-specific and campus-specific mailing lists and Facebook groups. All participants self-reported that they had been a grader, lab assistant, or teaching assistant for a Python course. 

\subsubsection{Results}

\textbf{Problems with Baseline} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend When asked to comment on good and bad variable names based on the baseline interface, most teachers immediately began scrolling through solutions one by one, taking notes as they went, fully aware that they would only be able to skim a small, random fraction of the total number of solutions. The sheer volume of solutions was overwhelming to some. 

Results of the post-baseline survey reinforce critical usability issues with the status quo that Foobaz was designed to address. In these survey responses, teachers expressed an appreciation for the simplicity, readability, and searchability of the baseline interface but wished that the endless stream of often very similar solutions could be summarized or ``de-duped'' before they had to read through them. One teacher requested that variables be automatically identified, so that all references to a variable can be highlighted. This may have been a direct consequence of the fact that it was not possible to search for all the occurrences of the variable name \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$i$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{i}} \DIFaddend without the browser also highlighting all the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$i$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{i}}\DIFaddend 's within the rest of the names and keywords, e.g., the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$i$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{i}} \DIFaddend in ``if.'' Another teacher requested an automated count of common variable names. These teachers anticipated three critical features of the Foobaz interface: deduplication, variable name counts, and highlighting all occurrences of selected names.

Two teachers commented on the importance of understanding the role a variable takes on within the program. One teacher writes, ``Many times the variable names meant something but I still had to read the code to make sure that it meant what I thought it meant in the context of the code.'' The second teacher observed, ``Whether a variable name is good or bad depends a lot on its function within the code, and since each code block has a somewhat unique structure, I felt like I should be creating separate categories for good vs. bad variables names, e.g., `for the derivative result,' `for a counter in a loop through poly,' etc.'' This is exactly what the Foobaz interface is designed to support.

\DIFdel{The approximately power-law-type distribution of stacks of code from the thousands of edX solutions has already been reported in prior work, such as Figure 12 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

Teachers slightly disagreed with the statement ``I saw a large percentage of these students' variable names'' ($\mu=2.6$, $\sigma=1.2$) and slightly agreed with the statement ``This interface helped me provide feedback to many students'' ($\mu=3.6$, $\sigma=2.0$).

\textbf{Efficiency of Foobaz} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend The efficiency of using Foobaz to create feedback came up repeatedly in teachers' survey responses. Teachers appreciated the feeling of doing the task ``at scale.'' One teacher noted that it felt like, ``with each action, I was helping a large number of students'' without ``repeating or wasting effort too much.'' While using the button that highlights and scrolls the next most popular, untagged variable name into view, a teacher told the experimenter, ``I love this button!'' The arrow key-based navigation through tables of variable names was appreciated as well. At least one teacher commented that ``seeing variable names grouped by their role made the process much more efficient.'' 

The efficiency gains of the interface were hampered by, at times, a noticeably sluggish interface response time to some queries that scaled with the size of the dataset. This sluggishness \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can be cut down by reducing the many unnecessarily repeated calculationsmade in the current implementation.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was significantly reduced by implementing the Foobaz teacher interface in a templating language instead than d3.js, precalculating variable name counts, and removing repeated calculations.%DIF >  as possible.%can be cut down by reducing the repeated calculations made in the current implementation.
}\DIFaddend 

\textbf{Quiz Composition} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend In both interfaces, teachers appreciated the potential pedagogical value of making quizzes: ``I \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{… }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{... }\DIFaddend liked that with the [quiz] I made, students can actually learn about good alternatives. ... [T]hey can change their variable names after putting extra thought into it.'' A teacher expressed appreciation that, using the Foobaz interface, they could generate quizzes based on actual submitted code as well as their own comments. 

\DIFdelbegin \textbf{\DIFdel{Coverage}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{. Immediately after using the baseline interface, teachers did not strongly agree or disagree with the statement ``I was able to give specific, personalized feedback to many students'' ($\mu =3$, $\sigma = 1.4$ on a 7-point Likert scale with 1: strong disagreement and 7: strong agreement). Teachers slightly disagreed with the statement ``I saw a large percentage of these students' variable names '' ($\mu=2.6$, $\sigma = 1.2$) and slightly agreed with the statement ``This interface helped me provide feedback to many students'' ($\mu=3.6$, $\sigma = 2.0$).After using the Foobaz interface, the mean level of agreement with these statements jumped to 5.5 ($\sigma = 1.7$), 6.3 ($\sigma = 0.46$), and 6.6 ($\sigma = 0.5$)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In spite of the unknown underlying distribution of good and bad variable names, the teachers find and label variables across all available categories in order to make quizzes. Figure \ref{tab:averageLabeling} shows that teachers labeled only a small fraction of the total number of unique names and still found multiple examples for each of the categories of quality, i.e., misleading/vague, too short, and fine/good}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure \ref{fig:comboquizcoverage} shows that most }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textbf{\DIFadd{Coverage}} \DIFadd{Most }\DIFaddend solutions in the edX datasets received at least one or two quizzes\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

}

\DIFadd{Due to technical difficulties, only one of the ten teachers }\DIFaddend used Foobaz to create quizzes for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a much smaller }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the 6.0001 }\DIFaddend dataset, collected from the residential class of only several hundred students.

}\DIFdelend 

Combined with Figure \ref{tab:averageLabeling}, Figure \ref{fig:comboquizcoverage} also shows that, by only labeling approximately 20 variable names in each of the edX datasets with thousands of student solutions, teachers cover at least 85\% of the class with personalized feedback quizzes. Even though Figure \ref{fig:variableCoverage} shows that the coverage of individual variable names with feedback is high, it matters less for Foobaz than in powergrading systems. What matters more is the coverage of students with quizzes that have \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{excellent }\DIFdelend examples of good and bad variable names students would not otherwise get to see and learn from.

\subsection{Student Study}

We ran a second study on the student side of the workflow in order to (1) find out if the teachers' efforts in the previous study produces quizzes that are relevant to these new students and (2) better understand student reactions to this novel form of feedback. In order to do this, we targeted beginner programming students and invited them into the lab \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for a one-hour session }\DIFaddend to receive personalized quizzes generated by the teachers in our previous study. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Two experimenters, including the author of this thesis, separately ran students through the study in parallel, using two different machines.
}\DIFaddend 

Before the start of the study, quizzes composed by teachers using Foobaz in the first user study were rendered using the edX framework, ready to be personalized. Since pilot testing with beginner programming students indicated that six alternative variable names in a quiz is too many, teachers' quizzes were randomly subsampled to include a maximum of five alternative names for students to consider. 

Students came into the lab for one hour and composed solutions to one of the four exercises. After receiving each solution, the experimenter mentally executed the solution and compared the behavior of its variables to the variable behavior covered by the teachers' quizzes. If there was a match to one or more teachers' quizzes, one quiz was randomly selected. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{While quiz personalization is now automated, during the study this feature was demonstrated to subjects using the wizard of oz technique. }\DIFaddend The experimenter made a copy of the student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solution }\DIFaddend and replaced every instance of the variable to be quizzed on by an arbitrary symbol, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{e.g.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{i.e.}\DIFaddend , a bold letter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{A}}\DIFaddend . The experimenter then appended the quiz to the modified copy of the student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend solution and delivered it to the student as a personalized quiz. If there was no match to one or more teachers' quizzes, then the student received a generic quiz, about a variable name in a solution other than their own.

After the student completed their personalized quizzes, they took a survey about their experience. Students who \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were able to complete }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{completed }\DIFaddend the coding exercise and quizzes with significant time left in their \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one-hour }\DIFaddend session repeated this process for a second programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assignment}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{Apparatus}

In all sessions, we used laptops with 15.4-inch or 13.3-inch screens. All participants' interactions with the system were logged using the edX platform infrastructure.

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 6 participants (4 female) who were either undergraduate or graduate students, through computer science-specific and campus-specific mailing lists, Facebook groups, and word of mouth advertising. Their ages were between 18 and 27 ($\mu=20.4$, $\sigma=3.2$). Four of the participants had taken one or two introductory programming courses on Coursera or at their high school or college campus. The remaining two participants had taken three or four classes that involved learning programming languages or computer science concepts, and had some experience with Python.

\subsubsection{Results}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend %DIF > \todo{DNHT: do I have examples?}
Six students took a total of 12 quizzes, 11 of which were able to be personalized, even though their solutions were, in some cases, significantly different from the prior student solutions seen by teachers during quiz creation. Correspondingly, in the surveys that followed, students agreed with the statement ``This quiz felt relevant to me'' at an average level of 5.4 ($\sigma = 1.0$) on a 7-point scale. One student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend solution did not receive a personalized quiz because its variables behaved in ways that no teacher in the previous study considered. That student was able to understand the new solution and take the quiz, though it had little relation to their own solution.

Students were asked in the post-quiz surveys about what they learned from the exercise. One student replied, ``Possible variable names are pretty much synonyms, but the more detailed/specific ones are better.'' Another wrote, ``It's worthwhile to pick good variable names.'' Students' average level of agreement with the statement ``The quiz made me think about what makes variable names good or bad'' was 6.2 ($\sigma = 0.9$) on a 7-point scale. Mean levels of agreement with statements about the quizzes being confusing or tedious were 2.9 ($\sigma = 1.5$) and 3.4 ($\sigma = 1.2$), respectively, on a 7-point scale.

Some students observed that this was a very subjective quality of their code to be quizzed on, but all students were able to understand and complete the quizzes they were assigned. Some students disagreed with the instructor-provided ratings. When this occurred and the teacher left no explanation, students had at least one of three reactions: (1) They tried to imagine what the teacher was thinking. (2) They expressed displeasure at the lack of explanation. (3) They decided that they still disagreed with the teacher's judgment. Students did pick up on the teachers' preferred naming conventions through the quizzes. As evidence for this, two students correctly wondered aloud whether a different teacher made each of the quizzes they saw during their session. Given the subjectivity of the task, it may be necessary to grade only on participation, rather than absolute agreement with the teacher.

Students were not informed that quizzes were populated largely by fellow student variable names, but one student volunteered their appreciation for a ``wide spectrum'' of variable names to consider. However, randomly sampling teachers' quizzes down to 5 variable names created some student confusion when there were no positive naming examples in the resulting quiz. This is evidence that sampling should be constrained to include both good and bad examples and the user interface should provide some additional guidance to remind teachers that students highly value a balance of examples, each paired with an explanatory comment.

This may reduce the number of student solutions that share common variables. While the Foobaz teacher interface supports merging similar common variables together for the purpose of making quizzes about a more general variable role, it may become too tedious for solutions to more complex programming problems. Fully or semi-supervised methods of merging common variables may need to be developed, which would also help OverCode scale to more complex programming problems.

One-on-one human tutoring is a costly gold standard in education. As established in Bloom's seminal work on tutoring, mastery-based instruction with corrective feedback can offer a substantial improvement in learning outcomes over conventional classroom teaching \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{bloom19842}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{bloom}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . However, personalized support does not scale well with the number of students enrolled. In large classes, it is often not feasible for students to get personalized hints from a teacher in a timely manner. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) can have even worse teacher-to-student ratios, by orders of magnitude. Intelligent tutoring systems have strived to simulate the type of personalized support received in one-on-one tutoring, but they are expensive and time-consuming to build.

\DIFdel{In this paper, we ask learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In this chapter, students are asked }\DIFaddend to generate personalized hints for each other. Prior work on \textit{learnersourcing} demonstrates how \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend can collectively generate educational content for future \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students}\DIFaddend , such as video outlines and exam questions, while engaging in a meaningful learning experience themselves \cite{kim2013learnersourcing,weir2015,mitros2015}. The proposed benefit of learnersourcing is that learners are not only more intrinsically motivated to engage with the learning content to begin with, but may also benefit pedagogically from the task itself.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This }\DIFaddend work builds upon learnersourcing by exploring how it can be applied to the generation of personalized hints during more complex problem solving. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Whereas }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{While }\DIFaddend prior work determined which \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{learnersourcing }\DIFaddend task to present to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learner depending }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student based }\DIFaddend on what information \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was still }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }{\it \DIFadd{system}} \DIFaddend needed \cite{weir2015}, many educational topics like digital circuit design require \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{more domain expertise , raising }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{some domain expertise that students are not equally well versed in. This raises }\DIFaddend the question of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{learnersourcing task routing. More specifically, }\DIFaddend which learners should be assigned to generate which hints\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Beyond learnersourcing subgoals for how-to videos, we tackle the core }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{? This work takes on the }\DIFaddend challenge of generating content that is tailored to both the \textit{hint-receiver}'s current progress and the \textit{hint-author}'s likely level of understanding. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We present }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter describes }\DIFaddend two workflows for learnersourcing hints that assign hint-generating tasks to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend based on what problems the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learner }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend has recently solved. In the \textit{self-reflection} workflow, students generate hints by reflecting on an obstacle they themselves have recently overcome. In the \textit{comparison} workflow, students compare their own solutions to those of other students, generating a hint as a byproduct of explaining how one might get from one solution to the other. The second workflow can operate on the output of the first, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}. In both workflows, the key insight is that, through their own experience struggling with a particular problem, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend can become experts on the particular optimizations they implement and bugs they resolve. The workflows can take pressure off teaching staff while giving students the valuable educational experiences of reflection and generating explanations. 

While such workflows could have many applications, this \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{paper }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{chapter }\DIFaddend presents a specific application within a college-level computer architecture class. In this course, students implement, debug, and optimize simulated processors by constructing digital circuits. During both the debugging and optimization process, hints are one mechanism for teachers to help students fix and optimize their circuits. This paper applies our learnersourcing workflows to two kinds of hints: \textit{debugging hints} and \textit{optimization hints}. A debugging hint is a student's attempt to help a future student change their solution so it generates the expected output for a particular input. An optimization hint is a student's attempt to help a future student get from one correct solution to another, more optimal solution. When hint-receivers encounter that particular situation during their problem-solving process, the hints can be shown to them as if they are the personalized hints an intelligent tutoring system might generate, or that a teacher might provide during a one-on-one interaction. 

\section{System Design}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We faced }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There are }\DIFaddend a number of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{decisions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{necessary decisions to make }\DIFaddend when designing interventions to collect and deliver hints. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Here we discuss these decisions, some alternatives, and the final workflow designs}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter provides some answers to key design questions in the context of two systems deployed within a computer architecture class: Dear Beta for learnersourcing debugging hints and Dear Gamma for learnersourcing optimization hints}\DIFaddend .

\DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Design Questions}} 

\DIFaddend {\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \it %%%
\DIFdel{When should learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \bf \DIFadd{When should students }\DIFaddend be asked to provide hints?} As soon as a student has resolved a bug, they may have some expertise about that bug that they can share with other students. If too much time has passed between resolving the bug and writing a hint, the student may forget necessary details and context, or forget the bug altogether. A previous learnersourcing system also prompted students to contribute content immediately after having experienced it themselves, for similar reasons\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \cite{weir2015}.

{\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \it %%%
\DIFdel{How should learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \bf \DIFadd{How should students }\DIFaddend access hints?} Hints can be distributed using either a \textit{push} or \textit{pull} model, and can involve displaying either \textit{all} or \textit{some} of the hints. For example, a push model might display hints as a constantly updating resource, whereas a pull model could dispense hints to individual students just-in-time, when a student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{needs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{requests }\DIFaddend help. The hints could be algorithmically selected based on the student's work so far and the hints they have already received. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We explored both }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter demonstrates both the }\DIFaddend push and pull models, using the push-all model for distributing debugging hints and the pull-some model for distributing optimization hints. Generating optimization hints was a required reflection activity, so the volume and redundancy of these hints made a push-all model potentially overwhelming.

{\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \it %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \bf \DIFaddend What hints can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the system designer }\DIFaddend ask, or allow, a student to generate?} In cases where the student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend \textit{start state} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend prior to overcoming an obstacle \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) }\DIFdelend and \textit{end state} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(after overcoming an obstacle ) are known , such as when a student fixes a bug, we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{after overcoming the obstacle are known or inferred, the system can }\DIFaddend ask the student to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{create a hint helping other students encountering a similar bug or start state}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{write a hint that would help someone else overcome the same obstacle}\DIFaddend . For example, in the case of circuit design, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we consider }\DIFdelend a student who has recently fixed a bug \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by }\DIFaddend resolving a particular \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification errorto }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFadd{autograder error}} \DIFadd{may }\DIFaddend be capable of writing a debugging hint \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{associated with that verification error. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for other students who get that autograder error. An autograder error occurs when a student solution does not return the expected values. 
%DIF > e.g., based on a solution failing one less test case since its last run, e.g., stop failing the same test case
}\DIFaddend 

In many cases, however, a student might not face any explicit obstacle, or their start state may not be known. For example, a student might naturally arrive at a highly optimal circuit design without having first tried a less optimal design. Regardless of the path to their solution, the student could generate hints by comparing their own solution to a more optimal solution, or to a less optimal solution. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In this paper, we explored }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter explores }\DIFaddend both of these directions by asking each student to do both comparisons. To keep hint generation relevant to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learner}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student}\DIFaddend 's current task and to minimize cognitive load, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we did not ask students }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students were not asked }\DIFaddend to generate hints between pairs of solutions when they were familiar with neither solution.

{\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \it %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \bf \DIFaddend How should hints be indexed?} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There are many possible ways to index the hints for more accurate retrieval later by students in need. For example, debugging hints could be indexed by the autograder error they are intended to resolve. Optimization hints could be indexed by the student start state, end state, or both with respect to performance. }\DIFaddend Indexing hints by a meaningful feature of student solutions allows students to more easily find relevant hints in a push model of hint distribution and allows the system to deliver more relevant hints to each student in a pull model of hint distribution. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Optimization hints could be indexed by the learner's start state, end state, or both with respect to performance. Debugging hints could be indexed by verification errors. 
}\DIFdelend 

During debugging, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend solutions are run through sequences of teacher-designed test inputs. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A }%DIFDELCMD < {\it %%%
\DIFdel{verification error}%DIFDELCMD < } %%%
\DIFdel{occurs when a student's solution does not return the expected values. }\DIFdelend Because test cases have a specification of actual and expected outputs for each input, we decided to index debugging hints by the tests for which the solution deviates from the expected output. In other words, debugging hints are associated with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error that disappears if the bug is resolved. 

During optimization, the goal is not simply to attain a correct solution, but rather to arrive at a more optimal correct solution. We decided to index optimization hints by both start and end states: the leap from a less optimal solution to a more optimal solution that the hint is intended to inspire. These states, the solutions themselves, are complex circuit objects\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. We }\DIFaddend use the number of transistors in a solution as a metric of its optimality. In this indexing scheme, all hints written with the intent of helping a student with a 114-transistor solution create a 96-transistor solution are binned together.

{\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \it %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \bf \DIFaddend Which hints should a student receive?} In the push-all model of hint distribution, this question is not relevant, but in the pull-some model of hint distribution, it may be critical. Ideally, students would receive a progression of increasingly specific hints, following patterns of adaptive scaffolding established in intelligent tutoring system literature \cite{andes}, helping them reach a more correct or optimal solution on the spectrum. 

This ideal still leaves room for design choices about exactly which hints to deliver in a pull model of distribution. For example, during the optimization stage of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a student's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an }\DIFaddend assignment, the system could \textit{always} give the student hints that help them create the \textit{next optimal solution} found by other students\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(see Figure \ref{fig:sankey})}\DIFdelend . This would hopefully be an optimization challenge that falls within the student's zone of proximal development \cite{ZMP}. However, this may be too cautious. If a student's solution is far less optimal than the \DIFdelbegin \textit{\DIFdel{most common solution}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{most common solution}\DIFaddend , then the system could give the student hints to help them leap directly to that most common solution, without first creating any intermediate solutions. This strategy ignores how large a leap outside their zone of proximal development this might be, but it ensures that the student is exposed to the ideas, presented in those hints, that are necessary for implementing a solution at least as optimal as the most common one. We chose this latter option, both hinting students toward the most common solution and hinting students with the most common solution toward the most optimal solution.

\DIFdelend {\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \it %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \bf \DIFaddend Should hint creation be a required task?} As discussed in Related Work, generating hints can be a valuable part of the learning process. We required all students to generate optimization hints as part of a reflection activity immediately after submitting their first correct circuit. We did not require students to generate debugging hints. This is because the number of bugs encountered could be large, and unlike optimizations, many bugs also may not lead to significant conceptual gain upon reflection. Because debugging hints are immediately pushed out to all students, we keep \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{both hint creation and upvotes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hint creation }\DIFaddend voluntary to minimize the signal-to-noise ratio in hint quality.

{\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \it %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \bf \DIFaddend How should the variation in hint quality be handled?} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In the push model of hint distribution}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Allowing students to upvote hints they find helpful provides one signal of quality. When available}\DIFaddend , we used \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend upvotes to sort hints\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{by quality. In the pull model of hint distribution, we took advantage of the redundancy of the hints , and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. When we required every student to independently generate hints and there was no affordance for upvoting helpful hints, we }\DIFaddend presented five hints at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{once. If }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a time to students in need of help. Even if }\DIFaddend one or more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{redundant }\DIFdelend hints were of poor quality, their aggregate message might still be helpful for a student. If most of the hints were about a feature that is irrelevant to the student receiving the hints, the remaining hint(s) might be about something different and more relevant. We limited each set of hints to a size of five to avoid overwhelming the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learner }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend with too many hints.

{\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \it %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \bf \DIFaddend How public should the hint-author be?} Many systems for question-answering have a reputation system, where the author is known and recognized for contributing answers. Previous work at CSCW has examined whether reputation would improve class forum participation \cite{reputation}. For simplicity, we chose to leave student identities hidden.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {\bf %%%
\DIFdel{Final Workflows}%DIFDELCMD < } %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Self-Reflection Workflow}} 

\DIFaddend In the self-reflection workflow, students iteratively modify their solutions to pass as many teacher-created tests as possible. For any \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error revealed by those tests, students can look up hints for what modifications might cause their solution to pass that test case instead. The hints are stored in a database indexed by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend errors they are intended to address. When students fix a bug in their own solution, they can reflect on their fix and contribute a hint to the database for others struggling with the same \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error. The self-reflection step turns a successful bug fix into a shareable hint. It is effectively a self-explanation exercise, since the hint is not a conversation starter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. It }\DIFaddend is meant to stand alone for any future student to consult. As studied in prior work \cite{selfexplanation}, self-explanation helps students integrate new information into existing knowledge.

\DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Comparison Workflow}} 

\DIFaddend In the comparison workflow, students compare their correct solution to alternative correct solutions previously submitted by other students or teachers. They are prompted to compare their solution to a solution \textit{W} with worse performance and generate an optimization hint for students who have solutions like \textit{W}. They are then prompted to compare their solution to a solution \textit{B} with better performance and generate an optimization hint for students who have solutions like their own, which are not yet as performant as solutions like \textit{B}. In each case, the student is generating an optimization hint to help students increase the performance of their solutions. Students who receive these hints use them as guidance while optimizing their own solutions. Figure \ref{fig:workflow} illustrates both workflows.

\DIFaddend \section{User Interfaces} 
We designed two user interfaces, one for each workflow. To learnersource debugging hints with the self-reflection workflow, we built and deployed {\it Dear Beta}, a Meteor web application that serves as a central repository of debugging advice for and by students in the class. The name alludes to both the ``Dear Abby'' advice column and the Beta processor that students create in the class. To learnersource optimization hints with the comparison workflow, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{built and deployed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{designed }\DIFaddend {\it Dear Gamma}, a web interface students were required to fill out as a reflection activity after submitting their final correct circuit for a class assignment.

\subsection{Dear Beta}

We applied the self-reflection workflow to processor debugging. Consider students working on their Beta processors within the digital circuit development environment provided by the computer architecture class. Students run a staff-designed test file {\it x} on their circuit. The development environment alerts them to a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error: for a particular input (test number {\it n}), {\it y} was the expected output and the student's circuit returned {\it z}. 

Students eliminate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend errors by fixing bugs in their circuits. They may use trial and error, methodically examine internal simulated voltages, or experience a flash of insight. On the Dear Beta website, they can post a hint for others derived from their insight and indexed by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error it caused. In the process of creating a hint, students have a chance to reflect on their own process of resolving the error.  Other students encountering that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error can look up these hints, upvote helpful hints, and contribute new hints. Hints for each error are sorted by the number of upvotes they receive.

After further examining their malfunctioning processor with no success, some students may open the Dear Beta website in order to get help (Figure \ref{fig:hints}). Dear Beta displays all errors and hints, sorted by test file name {\it x}, then test number {\it n}. The student can either scroll to find hints for their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error or jump directly to them by entering {\it x} and {\it n} into the bar pinned to the top of the page. If the error was not yet in the Dear Beta system, the error will be added and scrolled into view. 

If there are no hints yet, or if the hints are unhelpful, the student can click the ``Request'' button to the left of the error, which increments a counter. This button helps communicate the need for hints for a particular \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error to potential hint writers. This is analogous to the ``Want Answers'' button and counter on Quora, a popular question-and-answer site. 

If the student resolves their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error and feels that the existing hints were insufficient or incomplete, they can click in the text box labeled ``Add a hint!'' so that it expands into a larger textbox sufficient for typing out a paragraph of their own hint text (Figure \ref{fig:contrib}). Their new hint may be a clearer rephrase of an existing hint or hint at yet another way to resolve the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error. Given the variety of processor designs and implementations, there may be several ways any given \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend error may be thrown.

\subsubsection{Teacher Feedback on Early Prototypes of Dear Beta}

%DIF > \todo{finish removing we's}
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend After deploying initial prototypes of Dear Beta for two semesters, we invited Teaching Assistants to share their complaints, requests, and experiences with us. Four TAs were interviewed, in person or by email, and their feedback and experiences informed Dear Beta's final design.

Both $TA_{1}$ and $TA_{3}$ adapted to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dear Beta's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Dear Beta }\DIFaddend deployment by first asking each help-seeking student if they had already consulted Dear Beta. If they had not, $TA_{1}$ came back to them after visiting everyone else in the lab help queue. By then, they had often already resolved their problem with Dear Beta \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend hints, and had a new bug they wanted help debugging. 

Dear Beta was used as a debugging aid for both students and teachers. $TA_{2}$ described Dear Beta as a ``starting point'' for students, many of whom used it diligently during debugging. $TA_{2}$ appreciated that students who did ask for her help no longer said, ``My Beta isn't working. Tell me why.'' Instead, they used Dear Beta as a starting point, to help them identify potential locations of a bug in many pages of code. Not just helpful for students, $TA_{3}$ was able to describe with specific examples how Dear Beta \textit{helped him} help students quickly resolve common bugs.

$TA_{2}$ wondered if the extra hints were making it too easy to complete the lab, possibly letting students pass without understanding. $TA_{3}$ echoed this concern, but he made sure each student actually understood the Dear Beta hints whenever he personally guided them through the debugging process.

TAs identified both strengths and weakness in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dear Beta's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Dear Beta }\DIFaddend design. $TA_{1}$ strongly supported Dear Beta's existing design as a single scannable sorted list for quickly finding hints, rather than a purely search-based hint retrieval mechanism or the more general class forum. However, the affordances for contributing new hints in the initial prototype were not obvious and rarely visible on small screens. As a result, $TA_{2}$ was concerned that the level of student involvement in producing hints might be too low. The final Dear Beta design is more externally consistent with other participatory Q\&A systems, has more salient buttons for contributing new hints, and a responsive design that accommodates screens as small as that of a cell phone. 

$TA_{4}$ was absent during most of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dear Beta's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Dear Beta }\DIFaddend deployment but still regularly recommended Dear Beta to students who asked for her help over email. A fifth TA declined to be interviewed\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; she }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. She }\DIFaddend felt that she had not interacted with Dear Beta enough.

\subsection{Dear Gamma}

In order to learnersource optimization hints, we caught students at a different stage in their learning process: right after they passed all verification tests for a particular digital circuit, the Full Adder. Because students may have arrived at their solution without encountering any particular optimization obstacles, Dear Gamma uses the comparison workflow for learnersourcing rather than the self-reflection workflow. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The comparison workflow is modified slightly, to accommodate the requirements of the course lecturer, who wanted to make sure that all students get a chance to consider both the most common and the most optimal solutions. The collection of previous student solutions in Figure \ref{fig:workflow} was also curated by the lecturer. If a student's solution is larger than the most common solution, they are not shown solutions larger than their own; instead, they are asked to consider both the most common and the most optimal solutions, so they benefit from seeing both without doing extra work overall. Students with the most optimal solution only consider alternative solutions that are worse than theirs. Figure \ref{fig:deargamma} shows an example of the page for a student with a 114-transistor solution.

\label{fig:deargamma}
\end{figure}
\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In this activity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To collect Dear Gamma hints}\DIFaddend , students are given a pair of solutions and asked to give a hint to future students about how to improve from the less optimal solution to the more optimal solution. Students write hints for two such pairs of solutions. In each pair, one of the solutions is always their own. When the student's own solution is the better solution in the pair, then the student can hint at what the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{peer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{author of the less optimal solution }\DIFaddend might have missed. For example, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the student might write, }\DIFaddend {\it Remember DeMorgan's Law: you could replace the `OR' of `ANDs' with a `NAND' of `NANDs.'} When the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students'}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student's }\DIFaddend own solution is the poorer solution in the pair, they are challenged to first understand how the better solution uses fewer transistors, and then write a hint about the insight for a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{peer.

%DIF > Specifically, if a student's solution {\it S} is just as or more optimal than the most common solution, they are asked to (1) write a hint to help a future student with a less optimal solution reach solution {\it S} and (2) write a hint to help a student with solution {\it S} reach the most optimal solution.

\section{Evaluation}

To evaluate the extent to which learnersourced hints can support problem solving, we deployed Dear Beta and Dear Gamma to the computer architecture class, which had an enrollment of more than two hundred students. Dear Beta was deployed for 6 weeks, during which we collected student-generated debugging hints and observed the simultaneous usage of those hints in a real-world setting. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dear Gamma's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The Dear Gamma }\DIFaddend optimization hint collection interface was released to students as part of a particular lab. We then conducted a lab study with nine students to understand how they solve a typical engineering problem using these learnersourced optimization hints. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend The questions our evaluation sought to answer are: (1) {\it What are the characteristics of student-generated hints?} and (2) {\it Can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend solve problems using those hints?}

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Dear Beta}}
\DIFaddend The Dear Beta website was released as a stand-alone additional resource for students one week prior to the due date for the final circuit design lab. Students were made aware of its existence through a class forum announcement and signs on chalkboards in the course \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend computer lab. It was left up for the remainder of the semester for students to refer to, if completing work late. We tracked student logins and engagement with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the site 's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{site }\DIFaddend features. An initial prototype of Dear Beta was deployed for two consecutive semesters prior to this final system design and study, as well.

\subsubsection{Hint Succession and Categorization}
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend While Dear Beta makes all hints available at all times, Dear Gamma is modeled on the hint-giving mechanism of an intelligent tutoring system. In prior work, sequences of hints have been posited to facilitate learning due to their similarity with sequences used in expert human tutoring, as well as their support of human memory processes \cite{sottilare2014design}. Therefore, we further decomposed the hints collected with Dear Gamma into the three kinds of hints that typically comprise a hint sequence: 1) \textit{pointing hints} direct the student's attention to the location of error in case the student understood the general principle but did not know to apply it; 2) \textit{teaching hints} explain why a better solution exists by stating the relevant principle or concept; 3) \textit{bottom-out hints} indicate concretely what the student should do \cite{andes}. 

Two researchers independently categorized the 435 collected Dear Gamma hints into six different categories: pure pointing hints ($p$), pointing and teaching hints ($pt$), pure teaching hints ($t$), teaching and bottom-out hints ($tb$), pure bottom-out hints ($b$), and hints that are irrelevant or clearly not helpful. They first independently labeled the first 30 hints. After discussing disagreements and iterating on their understanding of the hint categories, the coders then categorized the remaining 405 hints. 

If one coder labeled a hint as a hybrid between two categories (i.e., teaching and pointing) while the other coder labeled it with only one category (i.e., pointing), we assigned the hint to the pure category (i.e., pointing) that was in common between the two coders' labels. If there was no shared category across the two coders, the hint was discarded. We also excluded the minority of hints (3.2\%) that were labeled as irrelevant or unhelpful.

\subsubsection{Lab Study}

Nine out of the 226 current students in the computer architecture course participated in the study. These students were recruited through a course forum post. Participants were given \$30 for the study, which lasted one hour. We informed students that we were studying the effectiveness of hints for optimizing circuits so that they use fewer transistors.

During the study, we presented the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hints }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Dear Gamma hints, which were collected from students in a previous semester, }\DIFaddend as anonymous, potentially helpful messages. Three batches of hints were shown in the order of pointing, teaching, and bottom-out, but randomly selected within each category. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Students began }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The lab for which the Dear Gamma hints applied was due earlier in the semester and all recruited students had completed it. Students began the study }\DIFaddend by opening up their previously completed lab and reviewing their solution. The experimenter noted down the number of transistors in their solution, and randomly selected five pointing-type hints for a solution of that size from the Dear Gamma collection. For example, if the student had 114 transistors in their solution, they received five hints previously generated by students who had written a hint to help improve a 114-transistor solution. Because hints may be of variable quality, the researcher presented hints in batches of five to increase the chances that one of them might be helpful.

The experimenter then asked the student to reduce the number of transistors in their solution. The experimenter explained that there were two more batches of five hints ready for them if they became stuck. These two batches were teaching hints and bottom-out hints. Students could consult outside resources like the course website and Google as well. 

After receiving each batch of hints, participants answered the following 7-point Likert-scale questions about each hint (1: strongly disagree, 7: strongly agree): (1) {\it ``This hint taught me something.''} (2) {\it ``This hint helped me get to a more optimal circuit.''} and (3) {\it ``I feel more confident that I could solve a similar problem in the future.''} We placed these questions immediately after each batch of hints to capture user perception of hints at the time they occurred. However, to avoid slowing down the problem-solving process, participants were asked to explain their answers in writing only after the study, in the post-study questionnaire. This rating process was repeated for the teaching hints and bottom-out hints, even if students were able to solve the problem without asking for these hints.

After the study, users completed a post-study questionnaire regarding their overall impressions. Because users were shown a batch of hints at a time, all of which were student-generated, in the post-study questionnaire we added additional Likert-scale items, ``I was able to find the most helpful hints and ignore the rest'' and ``Many hints felt repetitive,'' to understand whether users felt they could adequately ignore irrelevant hints. 

\DIFdelbegin \section{\DIFdel{Limitations}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{section}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{Because these }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Limitations}}
\DIFadd{These }\DIFaddend studies do not have control groups, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we cannot conclude on the magnitude of the effect on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{so we cannot make any claims about }\DIFaddend student learning. We can only report qualitative and quantitative measures of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{teachers' and students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend engagement with the system. Some of those observed behaviors and opinions may be derived from the participants' sense of novelty, rather than the underlying value of the system. We deployed Dear Beta in a real classroom setting, and in the context of a real assignment, for the purpose of observing natural interaction with the system. 


\section{Results}

\subsection{Dear Beta Study}

For the week prior to the lab assignment due date, the number of registered unique users in the Dear Beta system rose linearly from 20 to 166. It plateaued at 180 by one week after the lab was due. For comparison, the total number of students in the class was 226. 119 students logged in more than once and many students logged in repeatedly.

In the 9 days between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dear Beta's release }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Dear Beta release date }\DIFaddend and the lab \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend due date, users added 76 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{verification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{autograder }\DIFaddend errors and 57 hints as a response to those errors. Half of the errors received at least one hint. Seven errors received as many as three hints. Figure \ref{fig:betaengagement} shows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{user }\DIFaddend engagement with the system over time. As soon as the initial stock of hints were available, students began upvoting them.

Users contributed 61 upvotes and 10 downvotes on the hints during the same period. The highest number of upvotes (10) was given to the hint {\it ``When entering constants, 1\#4 is 1111 and 1'4 is the 4-bit representation of 1.''} Remember that, while this is a teaching-type hint, it is provided as a targeted troubleshooting hint for students whose solution fails to pass a specific test case. The second most upvoted hint (5 upvotes) was {\it ``Make sure your ASEL logic is correct - don't allow the supervisor bit to be illegally set.''} 

None of the hints appear to be incorrect, though this is difficult to verify, since the teachers do not have copies of the solutions from which these hints were generated. Even within a collection of hints for the same error, not all will be relevant to any particular solution.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Dear Gamma Study}

With the Dear Gamma hints, six of the nine laboratory subjects were able to improve the optimality of their circuits within the hour that the study took place. Figure \ref{fig:gammaresults} illustrates the subjects' revisions. One student only needed one set of pointing hints. Five students successfully revised their circuits after one set of pointing and one set of teaching hints. Four students received a set of final bottom-out hints as well. Three of those four students ($S_2$, $S_5$, and $S_9$) were still unable to successfully revise their circuits. 

{\bf Hint Distribution} Figure \ref{fig:sankey} is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend Sankey diagram of the optimization hints collected by Dear Gamma. The number of hints between certain key transitions, such as between the most common and the most optimal solutions, was far greater because of the lecturer's requests for pedagogically valuable hint prompts that introduced hint-writers to the common and optimal solutions. 

The most common solution size was 114 transistors. Students with that common solution were randomly assigned to generate hints from one of the many different larger solutions down to theirs. These hints are pooled together with the hints written by students with solutions larger than 114 transistors who are seeing the common 114-transistor solution for the first time. Less than five percent of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend solutions were the most optimal (96 transistors), but, at the request of the lecturer, every student was asked to consider that most optimal solution and write a hint for a fellow student on how to optimize their solution into that most optimal solution.

Students in the study were drawn from the same population as the hint-generating students, and all study subjects were offered the same number of hints (5 pointing hints, followed by 5 teaching hints, followed by 5 bottom-out hints) over the course of the hour-long session, regardless of the solution they started with.

  \end{center}

\end{table*}


{\bf Hint Types} Table \ref{tab:hintTypes} shows the breakdown of hints by type, along with representative examples. The Cohen's $\kappa$ \cite{cohen1960coefficient} inter-rater reliability was 0.54, which indicated that the two coders had moderate agreement across the six hint categories \cite{viera2005understanding}. 

{\bf Hint Prompt} Hint-authors interpreted the prompt to create a hint in different ways. Some addressed the hint-receiver directly ({\it ``Keep in mind that...''}), while others addressed the teaching staff ({\it ``I would mention [to the student]...''}). Some hint-authors did not directly write a hint, but instead wrote about how they would approach the situation of being a lab assistant for the hint-receiver: {\it ``I think first I'd ask to make sure they knew what a NAND3 was, because I think a solution like this might come from not totally understanding how it works.''} Still others took a conversational approach, as if they were having an unfolding conversation with the hint-receiver. Interestingly, a number of hint-authors referred to ``here'' or ``my circuit'' in their hints, as if the hint-receiver would be looking at the Dear Gamma interface, with all its examples, rather than just the text generated by the hint-author. This particular assumption on the part of the hint-author was confusing for hint-receivers.

{\bf Optimization Issues} $S_5$ was the only student who had a standard, optimizable solution, received hints, and had no insights about how to optimize the circuit within the allotted hour. $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_9$'s forward progress was confounded by having near-optimal top-level architecture and very large (suboptimal) implementations of the underlying modules. Dear Gamma only shows hint-authors the top-level architecture, not the underlying gate implementations, for the alternative solutions they compare their own solutions to. They therefore found the hints, which were often about fixing high-level architecture, irrelevant and unhelpful. Even so, $S_1$ was still able to revisit the hints and correctly extract the lesson that only inverting gates should be used. As a result, $S_1$ successfully optimized their circuit.

While working through their optimizations and hints, $S_6$ was the one student who significantly deviated from the correct line of thought by removing all inverting gates. \DIFdelbegin \footnote{\DIFdel{Optimal solutions have }%DIFDELCMD < {\it %%%
\DIFdel{only}%DIFDELCMD < } %%%
\DIFdel{inverting gates.}} %DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Optimal solutions have }{\it \DIFadd{only}} \DIFadd{inverting gates. }\DIFaddend As soon as $S_6$ saw that their transistor count had increased rather than decreased, they revisited the hints, realized their mistake, and correctly optimized their circuit. None of the hints themselves were incorrect, though some were deemed irrelevant or unhelpful.

{\bf Hint Progression} One student successfully optimized their solution from 150 transistors to the most common solution, 114 transistors, using only pointing and teaching hints. With some time left in the hour-long session, the student opted to optimize their circuit further. The experimenter gave the student one last set of hints, for the transition from 114 to the optimal 96-transistor solution. However, the experimenter did not restart the progression for this next transition\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The }\DIFaddend student was given a set of bottom-out hints \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{instead}\DIFaddend . Based on these hints, the student got the final optimization step without understanding, and appeared to feel cheated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{out of }\DIFaddend the satisfaction of figuring it out himself. 

{\bf Student Reactions} The six subjects without suboptimal gates agreed with the statement {\it ``Overall, these hints helped me get to a more optimal circuit''} ($\mu$=6, $\sigma$=1.1 on a 7-point Likert scale). The remaining three subjects with suboptimal gates disagreed with the same statement ($\mu$=2.6, $\sigma$=2.1 on a 7-point Likert scale). Regardless of whether a subject's solution included suboptimal gates, subjects on average agreed with the statement {\it ``Hints helped me think differently about the problem, even if they didn't directly help me solve the problem'' } ($\mu$=5.4, $\sigma$=1.6).

\label{fig:gammaresults}
\end{figure}

Some subjects commented on the redundancy within each set of five hints of a particular type. This was sometimes expressed as a negative, as in {\it ``These are all hinting at the same thing but I want new information,''} and sometimes expressed as a positive, as in {\it ``Several hints are mentioning X.... I should look into it.''} One student told the experimenter that, while the individual hints were hard to understand, together they formed a clearer picture in her mind about what to do.


\section{Discussion}
In this section, we first address the research questions the evaluation was intended to answer. We then explain that, of the design decisions made during the design of Dear Beta and Dear Gamma, the critical factors for success included prompt clarity, the index chosen for hints, how alternative solutions are represented, and the use of hint progressions.

\subsection{Answers to Research Questions}

Our study sought to evaluate the characteristics of student-generated hints. We can see from Table \ref{tab:hintTypes} that students, without coaching, can naturally produce hints that point, teach, give a bottom-out direction, or provide some combination of those elements. However, the number of pointing hints labeled by {\it both} coders as purely pointing-type (22) was much smaller than the number of such hints in the teaching (75) and bottom-out (64) categories. Because students were not informed that their hint would be slotted into a progression, it is possible they may have felt that if they were going to give a future student one hint, it would need to be more substantial than just pointing to a particular location in the solution and hoping the hint-receiver would see the possibility of optimization.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Secondly}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Second}\DIFaddend , the studies sought to evaluate whether \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend can solve problems using these hints. Both studies suggest that these student-written hints are helpful. The aggregate activity of students and teachers on Dear Beta indicate that the resource was populated with helpful hints. The Dear Gamma lab study was set up based on the observed sub-optimality of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend circuits at the level of choosing and arranging gates. Students whose solutions were suboptimal in that anticipated way rated the hints as helpful. Students whose solutions were suboptimal in unanticipated ways, i.e., at the level of the gates themselves, were not well-served by the hints. Future optimization hint workflows will need both (1) an optimality metric that accounts for multiple common types of suboptimality and (2) a representation of solutions with an appropriate level of detail about the difference between any two solutions. Regardless, the Dear Gamma study suggests that students are helped by the hints when the optimality metric and representation are appropriate.

\subsection{Lessons for Self-Reflection and Comparison Workflows}

Prompt clarity appears to be critical for soliciting the highest possible quality of hints from students. In Dear Gamma, hint collection and delivery were separate processes. Some students misunderstood the prompt and wrote hints as if their audience was still the teacher, not a fellow student. Others did not understand that the hint-receiver would only see the text of their hint, not the diagrams it was based on. In Dear Beta, hint collection and delivery were all mediated through the same, constantly updated interface. The appropriate audience for a hint was clear. Future instantiations of the self-reflection and comparison workflows should clarify who the audience is for hint-authors, perhaps by displaying what \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend will see. 

The selection of an index for hints in the self-reflection workflow matters. In Dear Beta, the choice of test file name and test number as an index for hints worked well for a class of hundreds of students. In a MOOC-sized course, the index may need to include an indicator that specifies how the test failed as well. Indices in future systems should have sufficient information to group related hints into clusters of a manageable size.

The success of the comparison workflow depends not only on the index for solutions, but also on how these solutions are represented in the workflow \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend prompt for hints. In the comparison workflow, we found that transistor counts sometimes did not account for lower-level reasons for a suboptimal circuit, resulting in hints that were unhelpful for solutions with lower-level suboptimality. Students will not generate hints that account for what has been abstracted away in the representation of solutions in the hint prompt. Likewise, if the definition of optimality used to index solutions does not account for a certain kind of suboptimality, the hints generated will be unlikely to help future students with that kind of suboptimality. 

Lastly, when students request hints as they did in the Dear Gamma lab study, conforming to the intelligent tutoring system model of providing progressively specific hints is recommended. To automatically create hint progressions in the future, we could apply machine learning methods to estimate a given hint's type. Alternatively, we could learnersource hint classification. 

\subsection{Generalization}
Although we applied these workflows to computer architecture problems, the self-reflection and comparison workflows could be extended to other domains. The workflows can be most readily applied to solutions that can be objectively tested for satisfying a set of requirements, e.g., passing unit tests, or whose optimality can be objectively measured. In domains without objective test cases or definitions for optimality, it may be more difficult to establish indices for clustering hints. In these cases, students could be asked to write what challenge they overcame or select from a growing list, enabling others to search for those terms. The comparison workflow could be modified to simply pair students with solutions different than their own, letting them judge for themselves which they think is better, the alternative solution or their own, and write hints based on that judgment.

\section{Conclusions}
This paper enriches learnersourcing by shaping the design space for learnersourcing personalized hints, and presenting two workflows that engage \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend in hint creation while reflecting on their own work as well as that of peers. We built Dear Beta and Dear Gamma, which apply these workflows to the creation of debugging and optimization hints, matching students to the appropriate hint creation task given their current progress. Results from our deployment study and subsequent lab study demonstrate the feasibility of these workflows, and indicate that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learner-generated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student-generated }\DIFaddend hints are helpful to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learners}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students}\DIFaddend . They also shed light on critical factors that may impact the quality of learnersourced hints, laying the groundwork for future systems in this area.

The original vision of OverCode was to discover pedagogically valuable themes of variation within thousands of student solutions to the same programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise. While OverCode does canonicalize and cluster correct solutions so that they can be more easily understood as a group, it does not pull out larger themes of variation as clearly as initially hoped for, nor does it handle incorrect solutions . This chapter describes more recent efforts to address both these shortcomings.

\DIFdel{One approach to pulling out larger themes of variation within solutionsis to cluster more aggressively. OverCode's existing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem. Each Python solution is normalized before clustering and represented as a sequence of normalized lines of code. All solutions that share the same set of normalized lines of code are clustered together. The clustering is a strict partition of the solutions. This clustering process is hard and agglomerative but not hierarchical. It was designed with interpretability in mind.

\cite{}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Programming language-based methods, e.g., compiler optimizations, could collapse OverCode clusters based on known semantic equality. As a system designer, one must decide or give the teacher control over how many different, semantically equivalent solutions are collapsed into a single cluster since, at the highest level, all correct solutions to the same programming exercise are semantically equivalent.

However, as a system designer, one must decide or give the teacher control over how many different, semantically equivalent solutions are collapsed into a single cluster since. %These methods are discussed again in the future work, because the second set of methods were chosen for future investigation in this chapter.

\DIFadd{However, OverCode's normalized stacks do exhibit statistical regularity}\DIFaddend . Given that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Variation Theory }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variation theory }\DIFaddend is interested in dimensions of variation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(and consistency ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and consistency }\DIFaddend that characterize all possible instantiations of an idea, statistical methods warrant further investigation. Latent variable models are a type of statistical model that attempt to explain variation in a dataset based on underlying factors. With the right choice of features and model, a latent variable model may be able to capture underlying design choices. In this section, two latent variable models have been explored in a preliminary way for this purpose: the Bayesian Case Model (BCM)~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{bcm} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{lda}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . 

BCM was selected because, like the original OverCode pipeline, it clusters solutions and produces a single solution to represent the entire cluster. Like OverCode, it also indicates the features that characterize each cluster. While OverCode displays the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{set of canonicalized lines that all members of a clusterdeterministically share}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution that shares the same set of normalized lines with all other members of the cluster}\DIFaddend , BCM learns a subspace of features that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it determines }\DIFaddend are most characteristic of the solutions within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cluster, in a probabilistic sense. 
It also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that cluster. 
}

\DIFadd{BCM }\DIFaddend has an interactive variant called iBCM\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which allows the user }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. iBCM allows the teacher }\DIFaddend to directly modify the prototype and the subspace chosen by BCM if it disagrees with their domain knowledge or preferences. This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{user modification }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher action }\DIFaddend triggers a rerun of BCM with the modifications taken into account.%is taken into account by the algorithm 

Internally, BCM depends on a mixture model with a Dirichlet prior. Rather than find a cluster for each entire solution, mixture models can learn clusters of features that co-exist across some subset of all solutions. The concentration parameter of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{BCM's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the BCM }\DIFaddend Dirichlet prior is set to promote sparsity, i.e., mixture distributions over solutions that have the majority of their probability mass on a single mixture component. BCM then assigns each solution to a cluster according to its most probable mixture component. %In other words, after fitting the model to the data, each solution will likely have a single dominant mixture component associated with it. If data points were documents instead of solutions, one would say that each document is determined to have a single dominating topic.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{LDA }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Since teachers can be poor at clustering solutions, i.e., inconsistent with each other~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ACESthesis}}%DIFAUXCMD
, it may also be difficult for any algorithm to find a clustering that appeals to most teachers. However, there are a statistical models, lie LDA, that cluster components of solutions instead of entire solutions. LDA }\DIFaddend was selected as an alternative \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{statistical approach to BCM because of evidence collected at UCBerkeley~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{} }%DIFAUXCMD
that experts were themselves not particularly consistent about how to cluster solutions. While LDA's output is not as optimized for interpretability as BCM 's, it preserves the ability to examine solutions through the lens of their mixture components, rather than clusters.

BCM was applied to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized cluster-representing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions generated by OverCode. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The platonic }\DIFaddend solutions encode both static and dynamic information\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in a readable function}\DIFdelend , i.e., the syntax carries the static information and the variable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{name }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{naming }\DIFaddend encodes dynamic information.

\subsection{\DIFadd{Preliminary Evaluation}}

\DIFadd{BCM was run on three }\DIFaddend different programming problems selected from those previously analyzed in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the chapter on OverCode.

An interface, shown in Figure~\ref{overcode_ibcm}, displayed the results, with iBCM continuing to run in }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{control used in the OverCode studies, (2) OverCode's canonicalized cluster-representating solutions, and (3) a BCM clustering of OverCode clusters, i. e., the prototypes and characteristic features of each BCM cluster, as well as its cluster members. The BCM interface , shown in Figure~\ref{overcode_ibcm}, was running the iBCM variant of the algorithm, so teachers could promote }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{backend, ready to update the clustering in response to teacher feedback. The interface afforded promoting }\DIFaddend a member of a cluster to be its prototype \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or click }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and clicking }\DIFaddend on a token within a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{prototype--a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{prototype, such as a }\DIFaddend variable name or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{keyword--to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{keyword, to }\DIFaddend toggle whether or not it is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{considered }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{labeled }\DIFaddend a characteristic feature of that cluster.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Both these modifications triggered BCM running in the backend to rerun and send a new clustering to the front end for display}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{In order to determine whether or not these clusterings and interface affordances are useful to teachers, a small pilot study was run on three teachers of introductory Python programming. For the pilot, two more interfaces were introduced as controls. One is a duplicate of the control interface used in the OverCode studies, i.e., a long list of syntax highlighted raw solutions in a random order in the browser. The second interface differs from the previous control by one factor: the raw solutions are replaced with their platonic equivalents.

\DIFadd{The teachers were each given sets of Python solutions to view in each of the three interfaces. For each problem, they were asked to create a grading rubric and provide helpful comments for the students of the type that might be mentioned in a class-wide forum post}\DIFaddend .

The three interfaces were: (1) raw solutions in the browser, similar to the control used in the OverCode studies, (2) the OverCode platonic solutions, and (3) a BCM clustering of OverCode clusters, i.e., the prototypes and characteristic features of each BCM cluster, as well as its cluster members. 
\DIFaddbegin 

 %DIF > Both these modifications triggered BCM running in the backend to rerun and send a new clustering to the front end for display. 

\DIFadd{The teachers }\DIFaddend appreciated the fact that BCM gave some structure to the space of solutions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; rather }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Rather }\DIFaddend than a long list of solutions, the interface suggested distinct subpopulations of solutions within the list. However, subjects did not fully understand the probabilistic nature of the clustering method. The presence of a single \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"intruder"}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{intruder}\DIFaddend , i.e., a solution that the teacher believed did not belong in a cluster, caused confusion. This could be ameliorated by giving \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend more ways to modify the clustering, e.g., allowing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend the option to kick an intruder out of a cluster and rerun BCM\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, or by introducing the tool as a mechanism for "discovery" instead of "organization.

One possible explanation for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this low consistency across teacher-made clusterings of student code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{poor consistency }\DIFaddend is that solutions are mixtures of design choices and teachers care \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{about different things.

Instead of trying to approximate clusterings that humans do not even agree on, it may be more useful to model solutions as mixtures of good and bad design choices. While more sophisticated mixture models' assumptions may ultimately be more appropriate, LDA \cite{lda} as implemented in the Gensim toolbox \cite{gensim} was chosen as the model to evaluate in this preliminary work. 

Like BCM, LDA was run on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized cluster-representing solutions, not raw solutions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solutions}\DIFaddend . However, the representation of these solutions was also changed: in order to pull out higher-level patterns in approach, rather than lower-level patterns in syntax, solutions were represented solely by the behavior of the variables within them. 

As described in the chapter on OverCode, the OverCode analysis pipeline executes all programs on a common set of test cases and records the sequence of values taken on by each variable in the program. OverCode assumes that variables in different programs that transition through the same sequence of values on the same test cases are in fact fulfilling the same semantic role in the program. %This sequence of values taken on by each variable in each program becomes a signature, i.e., the key to recognizing semantically equivalent variables across programs.  % and can therefore be considered the same {\bf common variable} uniquely defined by that sequence of values.

In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the previous }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{these }\DIFaddend examples, the input argument \texttt{base} would be considered \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend variable common to all three programs, but the input argument \texttt{exp} would not be. The variable \texttt{result} would also be considered a common variable shared across just the definitions in Figure \ref{whilestandard} and Figure \ref{augmentedwhile}. This allows us to distinguish between programs that calculate the answer in semantically distinct ways, without discriminating between the low-level \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{syntax-based design decisions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{design decisions about syntax}\DIFaddend . 

LDA is often applied to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{corpuses }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corpora }\DIFaddend of textual documents, where the corpus is represented as a $W \times N$ term-by-document matrix of counts, where $W$ is the vocabulary size across all documents and $N$ is the number of documents. In this representation, the document is represented a bag of word counts, i.e., how many times each word appears in the document. Following this analogy, solutions are represented as a bag of variable behaviors. The matrix representing the solutions in Figures \ref{recursive_example} through \ref{augmentedwhile} executed on \texttt{iterPower(5,3)} is shown in Table \ref{varbydocmat}.

Note that, while the entries in Table \ref{varbydocmat} only take on values $0$ or $1$, more complicated definitions may have $n$ instances of, e.g., a variable that takes on the sequence of values \texttt{3,2,1,0}. In that case, there could be an $n$ in the \texttt{3,2,1,0} column for the row corresponding to that solution, or it can be left as a binary indicator. %In other words, true to the assumptions made by LDA, these are occurrence counts, not binary indicators.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since the learned mixture components }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Inspection by hand can also be challenging. When LDA learns mixture components in this context, those components }\DIFaddend are distributions over variable behaviors\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, it is easier to inspect solutions which have high "amounts " }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Rather than inspect these distributions, entire solutions containing high amounts }\DIFaddend of that mixture component \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"within" them and infer a theme by comparing them to solutions that contain high "amounts " of a different mixture component. These comparisons were done by hand for a subset of popular mixture components for each LDA model.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were inspected instead. By comparing entire solutions with high and low amounts of each component, one can infer what each learned component captured. This method for understanding the results is similar to the recommendations of variation theory.

\subsection{\DIFadd{Preliminary Evaluation}}
\DIFadd{3875 student solutions to }\texttt{\DIFadd{iterPower}} \DIFadd{were run on a set of test cases within the OverCode analysis pipeline.

\DIFaddbegin \section{\DIFadd{Discussion and Future Work}}

\DIFaddend LDA applied to a variable-by-solution matrix is a promising method for identifying variation within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{corpuses }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corpora }\DIFaddend of solutions to the same programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdel{While understanding the contents of thousands of correct student solutions can be helpful in both residential and online contexts, another application of OverCode's pipeline and interface is supporting the hand-grading of introductory Python programming exam solutions, only some of which are correct. Incorrect solutions are defined as those that do not pass at least one test case in the teacher-designed test suite.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Hand-reviewing solutions is necessary because teacher-designed test suites were found to unfairly penalize some students and award undeserved credit to others. For example, a single typo in an otherwise well-written solution can cause it to fail all the test cases and receive no credit. Conversely, a solution that subverts the purpose of the assignment can still receive credit by returning the expected answer to some or all of the test cases.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{For the staff of 6.0001, the residential introductory Python programming courses at MIT, this can be one of the most time-consuming and exhausting parts of teaching the course. It can take an full workday for the entire staff of eight to ten teachers to sit in a room and review several hundred students' solutions by hand in order to assign a single numerical grade to each solution. 
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{There are two main technical contributions found in the GroverCode extension of OverCode: a modified pipeline that can canonicalize both correct and incorrect solutions and an interface designed for grading. Just as the original pipeline used variable behavior to canonicalize variable names, the modified pipeline uses variable behavior and the syntax of statements containing each variable to canonicalize variable names in solutions that are not correct. This comes from the insight that a variable in an incorrect solution can be semantically equivalent to a variable in a correct solution but still behave differently; it can behave differently due to a bug in a line of code that directly modifies its value or a bug in a line of code that affects the behavior of another variable that it depends on. Since many of the exam solutions are incorrect and do not get clustered together, the new user interface organizes solutions according to their behavior on test cases and compositional similarity to each other, rather than by cluster size.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{GroverCode was iteratively designed and evaluated as a grading tool through two live deployments during the Spring 2016 6.0001 staff exam grading sessions. Approximately two hundred students were enrolled in the course, and nine instructors used GroverCode to grade nearly all student code submissions. A total of seven programming exercises of a variety of difficulties were graded over the course of these two sessions. GroverCode was particularly appreciated on simpler problems where correct solutions were clustered together and graded by a single teacher's action. The canonicalization process applied to more complex solutions, especially those which included student-written objects, was at times more harmful than helpful for teacher's comprehension of student code. Conversely, the feature for grouping solutions based on their behavior on test cases was appreciated regardless of solution complexity.

To better explain each test failure, the solution's differing actual and expected outputs are also displayed. 
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The panel of progress indicators and filters is always in view. The rows of aligned sequences of green checks and red dashes represent "error vectors", the pass/fail results with respect to the ordered list of teacher-specified test cases. The checkbox next to each error vector allows the teacher to selectively view subsets of solutions based on the particular tests they pass and fail. Solutions with the same error vectors may include similar mistakes.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Correct solutions are stacked the same way they are in OverCode. In contrast, incorrect solutions were canonicalized but not stacked, even if they were identical after canonicalization.

\DIFdel{The GroverCode implementation is a modification of the OverCode pipeline, including the updates described in Section~\ref{subsec:morelineinfo}. Solutions which return an expected output for all test cases during the preprocessing step are categorized as "correct", and all other solutions, having failed at least one test case, are categorized as "incorrect". Correct solutions are canonicalized by the same process as was used in the original OverCode. 
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{In the original OverCode pipeline for correct solutions, variable behavior is assumed to hold enough semantic information to be the sole basis on which variable names are canonicalized. In this first version of GroverCode, applies this rule to incorrect solutions as well, but only for variables whose behavior matches a common variable in the correct solutions. %DIF < if a variable in an incorrect solution has the same behavior as a common variable in the correct solutions, GroverCode will rename the variable in the incorrect solution so it matches the common variable's name in the correct solutions.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{However, that purely behavior-based renaming strategy may change in future versions of GroverCode because, given that incorrect solutions are known to be wrong with respect to input-output behavior, the behavior of the variables within them is suspect too, regardless of whether it happens to match a common variable in a correct solution.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Consider the following example: in the syntax of an incorrect solution, a variable $i$ may be operated or depended on exactly the same way as a common variable in a correct solution. However, if an error somewhere else in the solution causes $i$ to behave differently, the original method of variable renaming will be thrown off. Based on this example, variables in incorrect solutions that are not already renamed based on behavior are renamed based on syntax.

Therefore filtering by error vector may have been one of the stronger contributors to any hypothetical decreased cognitive load due to using GroverCode over the status quo of random assignment to solutions in a CSV file.

\DIFdelend \section{Design Decisions and Choices}

%As the complexity of code increases, students face more design decisions.

This thesis work began with the vision that a teacher would someday be able to look at a display summarizing hundreds or thousands of student solutions to the same problem and immediately see---and comment on---good and bad design decisions that students made. The number of possible distinct student solutions grows rapidly with the number of design decisions and design choices students can make. 

The solution space could be imagined as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a large n-dimensional spacewhere each solution has a single coordinate. Each }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an $n$-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a }\DIFaddend design decision, e.g., whether to solve a problem iteratively or recursively\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, would be a dimension in the solution space. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The design }\DIFaddend choices students make could be thought of as discrete points along \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that dimension in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{each dimension in that }\DIFaddend solution space. While the number of distinct combinations of design choices students choose can be large, the number of dimensions in this space, i.e., the underlying design decisions, grows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{much }\DIFdelend more slowly. 

However, the structure of this hypothetical solution space ignores how design choices affect each other. Some design decisions are mutually exclusive, e.g., looping over a particular array with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a for or a while}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{for}} \DIFadd{or }\texttt{\DIFadd{while}}\DIFaddend , some decisions are correlated with one another, and some decisions are completely independent. A tree-like description of the solution space can capture some of these relationships between decisions. If a node represents a design choice, e.g., to loop over an array, there may be two or more choices, e.g., a \texttt{for} or a \texttt{while} loop, that can be represented as child nodes. The choice to use a \texttt{for} loop poses an additional design design, e.g., whether to use \texttt{range} or \texttt{xrange}: \texttt{for i in [x]range(input)}. The average depth of the tree would correspond to the average number of design decisions the students faced and the average branching factor would correspond to the average number of distinct choices students in the corpus make at each decision point.

The curse of dimensionality predicts that, as we add more and more dimensions to the solution space, the density of solutions will decrease and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{liklihood }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{likelihood }\DIFaddend that any two solutions occupy the same location in that space will go down. The regularity of code discussed in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the chapter on related work }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Related Work }\DIFaddend should help ameliorate the curse of dimensionality, but only partly. In other domains, it is often necessary to collect more data as the dimensionality of the space increases. However, given that the solutions are generated by students, the number of correct solutions are more likely to go down rather than up as the complexity of solutions, and the associated dimensionality of the solution space, increases.

This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{difficulties posed by high-dimensional spaces have been addressed, in each problem tackled, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{vision of the solution space inspired and is shaped by the concrete systems built and described in this thesis. In each system, the dimensions of solution variety have been tamed and orderd }\DIFaddend by choosing what \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{information }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{features }\DIFaddend to ignore and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, in some cases, what information }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{what features }\DIFaddend to index by. For example, OverCode ignores white space, comments, variable names, and statement orders. It indexes by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend lines. In order to assign a variable name quiz, Foobaz looks at the behavior of the variables in the student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend solution, ignoring everything else about \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the solution's composition. ClassOverflow }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it. Dear Beta }\DIFaddend and GroverCode forget what values cause a solution to fail a test case, preserving only that the test case has failed. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The optimization hint-collecting workflow within ClassOverflow }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Dear Gamma }\DIFaddend ignores circuit topology and indexes by the number of transistors.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It is important to note that this work is not intended to capture an enumeration of all possible design choices and resulting solutions. It is intended to capture the design choices students are actually making. The relative popularity of these choices is discussed in the section that follows.
}\DIFdelend %DIF > It is important to note that this work is not intended to capture an enumeration of all possible design choices and resulting solutions.

\section{Capturing the Underlying Distribution}

There will be some design decisions within each solution that are rare and some that are common, some that exemplify good programming practices and others that do not. These decisions might create inefficient solutions, reveal a student's fundamental misunderstanding, or use a feature of the language in a creative way. The distribution of solutions along these dimensions of variation may reflect student prior knowledge, teacher explanations, and common misconceptions. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{During Hannah Wallach's invited talk at the interpretable machine learning workshop at ICML 2016, she made the following observation: computer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Computer }\DIFaddend scientists are often looking for better ways to find needles in haystacks and computationally-minded social scientists are trying to characterize the haystack\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OverCode characterizes the haystack by identifying and displaying the relative popularity of different correct solutions. It also provides filtering and cluster-merging tools that help teachers find needles, e.g., interesting and unusal solutions.

}

\DIFadd{Foobaz characterizes the haystack of variable naming choices by diplaying the relative popularity of different names in each OverCode stack of solutions and across the entire dataset of solutions. The feature of sorting by popularity allows teachers to see the common names as well as the needles, i.e., uncommon names that might be excellent or terrible. 
}

\DIFadd{The learnersourcing workflows helped students, in addition to teachers, understand the distribution of solutions and bugs. Dear Beta reveals some information about the distribution of failed test cases. The variety of student debugging hints for each failed test case reveals some information about how many different possible problems might cause each failed test case. In Dear Gamma, the optimality of circuit solutions was quantified as the number of transistors. The haystack was characterized by visualizing the distribution of solutions from least to most optimal. This distribution was examined by teachers and given to students after they completed their own solution. The distribution helped teachers identify the most optimal solution, which represented a needle, i.e., a very small proportion of all solutions.

\section{\DIFadd{Helping Teachers Generate Solution-Driven Content}}

\DIFadd{The future generations of tools like OverCode, Foobaz, Dear Beta and Dear Gamma might allow teachers to continuously mine the solutions of their thousands of current and previous students, generating days worth of lessons just by extracting themes from both the innovative and problematic design decisions found in the growing pile of student solutions. This would be an opportunity to discuss and reflect on the various trade-offs that exist in each different solution or optimization. 
}

\DIFadd{Turning teacher actions and annotations into personalized feedback for students need not be restricted to variable names. For example, when a teacher writes a rewrite rule in OverCode, OverCode could treat that as an implicit annotation that one sytactic form is semantically quivalent and stylistically superior to another. Like Foobaz's variable name quizzes, the teacher's implicit or explicit commentary could be sent to current and future students as a personalized quiz or just a helpful suggestion. Ideally, all the work that a teacher does in an interface to make sense of student solutions could be automatically translated into solution-driven discussion content and rich feedback.
}

\DIFadd{These solution-driven lessons and feedback would be reuseable as long as the problem specifications do not change. This aligns well with the lifecycle of many courses that are eventually offered at scale. First, the material is iteratively developed and debugged in residential, face-to-face teaching environments. When the course is stable, it can be put up online for a larger number of remote students to engage with. Finally, the course can be archived in such a way that any new student can move through the material at their own pace, but there is no guarantee of staff or a cohort of fellow students moving through the material synchronously. Tools like OverCode, Foobaz, Dear Beta, and Dear Gamma accumulate solutions, commentary, and hints in such a way that, after enough students and teachers have used them for a given problem, new students can benefit from them without synchronous peers or teachers.

\DIFaddend \section{Writing Solutions Well}

The focus on introductory Python programming courses is often just correctness. The MIT EECS introductory Python programming course whose staff used GroverCode makes it a policy not to penalize students on how their solution is written. This means that they sometimes have to hand out full marks to a solution that makes them groan.

This policy may exist for several reasons. The first is the clarity of the policy: if it is correct, it gets full credit. Second is the clarity of the evaluation: if it passes the suite of test cases, it is correct. Third is the apparent appropriateness of the objective for novices: it may be too hard for novices to write a solution well in addition to achieving correctness. % worry about writing well in addition to writing correctly.% bear both the cognitive load of writing a solution well in addition to correctly.

However, it can also be very hard to achieve a correct solution if it is not written well. Something as simple as poor variable names, such as giving an array index a name that suggests it holds the value of the array at that index, can cause students to produce incorrect code.

Just as there is no silver bullet for writing prose well, there is no silver bullet for writing solutions well. Solutions, prose, products, buildings etc., are all designed, and each community has its own ways \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for how }\DIFdelend to help students make good design decisions. For example, in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Steven Pinker's book "}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFaddend The Sense of Style\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{", he suggests and then demonstrates how to pick }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin }\DIFadd{, Steven Pinker suggests picking }\DIFaddend apart examples of good writing to understand what makes them good\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Students of a particular design form may attend }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{pinkersense}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The software industry uses one-on-one peer review, often called code review, to find bugs and judge design decisions. This may also serve as an informal teaching opportunity for software engineers. Some communities create }\DIFaddend design studios, where \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{they discuss each of their work in turn and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{students }\DIFaddend give and receive constructive criticism from peers. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In both these examples of prose and design, the designed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Designed }\DIFaddend objects are examined individually and also as a group, emulating the conditions for learning from variation espoused by the theories of learning reviewed in the related work. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Perhaps because software can be marvelously complex, there is less of a design studio culture for software. Many }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Written rubrics can serve as a complement to peer review and design studio practices. For example, some }\DIFaddend software companies compose and maintain prescriptive style guides against which new code is carefully compared. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These guides }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, these guides may be more prescriptive than descriptive. In other words, they }\DIFaddend are not necessarily built on data about how software engineers actually design \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and write }\DIFaddend their code. %DIF > Code reviews, where peers give feedback on newly written code, are a standard practice in this industry. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{While peer review is not a design studio, they are closer to that mode of education. Peer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Design studios and peer reviews are not yet a standard practice in programming education. However, peer }\DIFaddend review practices are now \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{being }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{starting to be }\DIFaddend used in large online courses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in order }\DIFdelend to make up for small teacher-to-student ratios. Some residential software engineering courses, e.g., MIT's 6.005, also set up infrastructure for peer review\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, even when the number of staff members is sufficient. This }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Peer review }\DIFaddend forces students to engage with some \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(usually random) sampling of how other students solved a problem}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sampling of other student solutions}\DIFaddend . 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend work in this thesis takes this idea farther. Rather than hope that the randomly assigned peer review experiences provides students with a sufficient variety of examples, the work in this thesis attempts to pull out the design dimensions as well as concrete examples along those dimensions and, when possible, ask students to engage with them in a targeted, personalized way. 

This may be helpful even at the level of introductory programming. For example, according to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Variation Theory}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variation theory}\DIFaddend , a student will understand the concept of a loop in a more generalized, robust way if they have seen all the different ways in which their peers have written that loop. The teacher can quickly and easily provide an expert \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend perspective by commenting on the popular and rare choices. Students can be overwhelmed by choices\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, e. g., "}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. For example, they might ask themselves, }{\it \DIFaddend Should I use \texttt{range} or \texttt{xrange}? Does it matter?\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{" }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin } \DIFaddend With concrete examples, teachers can help students identify what matters and what does not. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Many students now taking introductory programming courses will take these skills with them to other majors. While computer science majors can acquire the skills of writing code well in more advanced software engineering classes, the lessons in introductory courses on writing code well may be the only ones non-majors ever get.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The OverCode pipeline performs }\DIFaddend unsupervised clustering. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Clustering is a function of similiarity measures and mechanisms for grouping or splitting clusters of data points. There is no true correct answer, but there }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There }\DIFaddend are distinct failure modes when using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clustering }\DIFaddend in the context of teachers reviewing solutions. Two are most relevant in this work. First, the representation of the solution and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/or }\DIFdelend the measure of similiarity between solutions can ignore, hide, or otherwise fail to capture what the teacher cares about. Second, when \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(1) }\DIFaddend the teacher cannot \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{infer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{easily decide }\DIFaddend what a cluster \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"means " }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{means to them }\DIFaddend based on its members and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(2) }\DIFaddend the clustering algorithm cannot explicitly communicate why the cluster exists, the teacher may not trust the clustering and may not feel comfortable using it for propagating feedback and grades back to students. This is exacerbated when the teacher discovers a member of a cluster that seems not to belong.

The OverCode clustering pipeline attempts to escape the first clustering failure mode: erasing distinctions that the teacher may care about. For reasons discussed in detail in the OverCode chapter, OverCode is designed to reveal to the teacher what their students' solutions actually look like, modulo white space and comments. These solutions are rendered for the teacher using the most common variable names and statement orders. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \todo{check the statement order} %%%
\DIFdelend To stay true to what students actually wrote, this process preserves syntactic differences. For example, when iteratively exponentiating \texttt{base} to an exponent, there are multiple ways to multiply an accummulating variable \texttt{result} by \texttt{base} and save the product back into \texttt{result}, such as \texttt{result *= base} and \texttt{result = result * base}. If the teacher just gave a lecture on common forms of syntactic sugar, OverCode will be sensitive to whether or not students use it. OverCode would allow teachers to observe whether students absorbed the lesson on syntactic sugar based on the way they write their subsequent solutions. The fact that even small differences in syntax creates separate clusters within the OverCode pipeline nearly ensures that any syntactic choices a teacher is interested in has been preserved and can be filtered for in the interface.

First, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{there }\DIFaddend is a clear interpretation of what an OverCode cluster can and cannot include, based on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the canonicalized solutionthat represents it}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{its platonic solution}\DIFaddend . Specifically, all solutions in the cluster have the same set of lines \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{after the behavior-based canonicalization of their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as the platonic solution after normalizing }\DIFaddend variable names, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regularization of white space, and removal of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{standardizing formatting, and removing }\DIFaddend comments. Second, the differences between clusters is made clear by highlighting which lines make the non-reference clusters different from the reference cluster. Third, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode }\DIFaddend filtering features and rewrite rules help teachers change their view of solutions into one that preserves the differences they are explicitly interested in and ignores those they are not interested in. Note that filtering by semantic choices may only be possible when the work on Bayesian modeling of these solutions becomes more mature.

In general, the interfaces in this thesis cluster complex objects and visualize those clusters so that there is little guesswork about what is included and excluded in a group and what the boundary between groups is. There are no outliers that are grouped with something else without explanation. Rather than losing faith in the clustering process, outliers can be used as the teacher sees fit to spur improvements either to the software infrastructure of the course, e.g., the input-output testing harness, or the examples students are asked to engage with.

It is not surprising that the evolving values of variables would carry significant semantic meaning in code written by students at the introductory level in languages like Python and Matlab, especially if the style of programming is procedural. This thesis confirms that within the context of introductory procedural Python programs. According to Taherkhani et al.~\cite{taherkhani2010recognizing}, variables carry useful semantic meaning in object-oriented and functional programming styles as well. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Taherkhani et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

The thesis presents a series of case studies about how to present the variety of programming solutions in a human-interpretable way and make use of it in pedagogically valuable, scalable ways. The methods described only work in a particular domain of solutions: \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{those that are executable and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{executable programs that }\DIFaddend solve the same programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem}\DIFaddend . This excludes natural language, for example. These case studies embody the design principles espoused, but there is no validated unifying recipe by which a corpus of student solutions can be processed and used. Each corpus and set of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{teachers' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher }\DIFaddend values were considered together in order to engineer a representation of solutions--both in the pipeline and in the user interface--that would empower teachers and benefit students.

This thesis demonstrates several ways to capture distributions of student solutions and make this information useful to teachers and students in large programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{classes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{courses}\DIFaddend . Capturing commonalities can save teachers time and exhaustion by summarizing many solutions with a single representative. It can also direct teachers to where the majority of the class is within the space of solutions or errors, so they can respond to student needs based on data, not hunches. Capturing variation allows teachers to see how students deviate from the common choices in ways that are superior and deserving celebration or inferior and requiring corrective feedback. These deviations can be used to inspire or directly seed exercises based on modern theories of how students learn generalizeable knowledge from concrete examples. It also saves teachers the time and effort of generating pedagogically valuable examples themselves. Systems in this thesis also demonstrate how the inherent variation in student solutions can be automatically presented back to students, as an active reflection exercise that can benefit both current and future students. 

The technical challenges tackled in order to capture and display distributions of solutions include designing solution representations, measures of similarity between solutions, mechanisms for grouping or filtering them, and human-interpretable displays. Challenges in workflow design centered around simple, minimally-intrusive ways to perform targeted learnersourcing in an on-going programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{class}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{course}\DIFaddend .

\section{Summary of Contributions}

The original OverCode system included a novel visualization that shows similarity and variation among thousands of Python solutions, backed by an algorithm that uses the behavior of variables to help cluster Python solutions and generate human-interpretable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solutions }\DIFaddend for each cluster of solutions. The Foobaz system demonstrated how, even when an aspect of variation is hidden in one view of a distribution of solutions, it can be exposed, in context, in a separate view. Additional follow-on work expanded \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's canonicalization }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode normalization }\DIFaddend process to incorrect solutions and explored additional human-interpretable mechanisms for identifying population-level design alternatives.

Foobaz contributed a workflow for generating personalized active learning exercises, emulating how a teacher might socratically discuss good and bad choices with a student while they review the student's solution together. The Foobaz system demonstrates one concrete way in which a conversation about design decisions, i.e., variable naming, that might only happen in one-on-one interactions with an instructor, can be scaled up to an arbitrarily large class, personalized to each student, be based on the distribution of naming choices found in solutions composed by the teacher's current class or previous classes, and deployed to future classes who assign the same programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem}\DIFaddend .

Finally, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ClassOverflow, which collectively refers to the Dear Beta and Dear Gamma workflows , contributes the concept }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the self-reflection and comparison workflows demonstrate the potential }\DIFaddend of targeted learnersourcing. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dear Beta }\DIFdelend self-reflection workflow allows students to generate hints for each other by reflecting on an obstacle they themselves have recently overcome while debugging their own solution. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dear Gamma }\DIFdelend comparison workflow prompts students to generate design hints for each other by comparing their own solutions to alternative designs submitted by other students. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Results from these studies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Studies of the Dear Beta and Dear Gamma systems }\DIFaddend show that personalized hints \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{collected through these workflows }\DIFaddend can be viably learnersourced, and that these hints serve as helpful guides to fellow students encountering the same obstacle or attempting to reach the same goal.

\section{Future Work}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``}\DIFaddend One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done...\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{" }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'' }\DIFaddend - Marie Curie (1984)

There are many directions in which this work can be grown. Some of the research that has been published in parallel with this work can be directly incorporated into future systems. At the same time, many of the existing features can be improved without incorporating any new techniques, based on already collected feedback during user studies, deployments, and other design critiques.

\subsection{OverCode}

OverCode was designed for thousands of correct solutions to introductory Python programming problems. Many residential and online exercises now afford automatic, immediate feedback about the correctness of a solution. Under these conditions, nearly all the final solutions are correct, but it is clear from reading through them that some students have better command of programming than others, just based on compositional quality. As a result, OverCode was designed to reveal to the teacher what their students' solutions actually look like, modulo white space and comments. These solutions are rendered for the teacher using most common variable names and statement orders.\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \todo{check the statement order} 
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend %DIF > \todo{check the statement order} 

However, as programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercises }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problems }\DIFaddend escalate from the simple to the complex, OverCode's utility breaks down. It can still create \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized cluster-representing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions and display them in a way that helps teachers spot contrasts, but the clusters themselves become smaller and smaller. As programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercises }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problems }\DIFaddend require more complex solutions, there is also an increasing need to go beyond representing what students actually wrote and toward human-interpretable representations of larger clusters. There are two promising complementary avenues for implementing this next step.

The first avenue is more bottom-up clustering. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Just as the variation in variable names was hidden by recognizing that variables across programs were semantically equivalentand could be replaced with their most popular student-given name, it may be possible to do the same with respect to semantically-equivalent subexpressions.

Overcode then renames variables to their most common name across all solutions. This normalization process could be extended to subexpressions and code blocks as well, using semantics-preserving transformations, e.g., compiler optimizations, and probablistic semantic equalivalence (PSE)}\DIFaddend ~\cite{codewebs}. OverCode could\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{feature an additional button which collapses these detected equivalences, showing the most popular choice in the solution representing the new, larger clusters}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, in the future, replace semantically equivalent or PSE subexpressions with their most common form across all solutions. Alternatively, this process could be controlled by the user, who decides the degree to which they would like to hide less common semantically equivalent subexpressions}\DIFaddend . An interface \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, perhaps like the teacher interface in Foobaz , can }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{like Foobaz could }\DIFaddend allow teachers to view and compose feedback \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that dimension of variation, if they wish}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on the distribution of semantically equivalent subexpressions, just as Foobaz allowed teachers to do for variable names}\DIFaddend .

%DIF > Just as the variation in variable names was hidden by recognizing that variables across programs were semantically equivalent and could be replaced with their most popular student-given name, it may be possible to do the same with respect to semantically-equivalent subexpressions. There two promising ways to determine the semantic equivalence of subexpressions or lines of code in large corpora of student solutions: (1) semantic equivalence based on the rules of the programming language (2) probablistic semantic equivalence based on the dynamic behavior during execution on test cases, as defined in Nguyen et al.~\cite{codewebs}. 
\DIFaddbegin 

%DIF > OverCode could feature an additional button which collapses these detected equivalences, showing the most popular choice in the solution representing the new, larger clusters. An interface, perhaps like the teacher interface in Foobaz, can allow teachers to view and compose feedback that dimension of variation, if they wish. 

\DIFaddend The second promising avenue for creating larger clusters is continuing to model the corpus of solutions to the same programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem }\DIFaddend as samples from an underlying distribution of solutions shaped by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the teacher 's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher }\DIFaddend explanations, student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend prior knowledge, common novice misconceptions, and the constraints of the language itself. Depending on the model chosen, larger clusters could be groups of whole solutions or groups of sub-components the co-occur within many solutions. Iterating on solution representation, model choice, interface, and interaction will hopefully allow teachers to understand their students' design choices, give style feedback, and assign grades with confidence. 

Even simple additions to the OverCode interface could approximate what more sophisticated statistical methods would do. For example, LDA may pull out distributions of commonly co-occuring variable behaviors \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(as described in the chapter on OverCode extensions), }\DIFdelend but the current OverCode interface could be modified to suggest and filter by common sets of strictly co-occurring variable behaviors. This approximation is less robust in the face of noise, but it is at least easier for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{user }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher }\DIFaddend to interpret using the language of filtering. %mechanisms. rather than relying on LDA , applied to identify common types of solutions, the OverCode interface could suggest and support filtering for solutions that have a common set of strictly co-occuring variable behaviors. 

When visualizing the resulting clusters, it is important to keep in mind the ease with which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend can interpret the results. Simple modifications to the OverCode interface can go a long way, such as highlighting the sub-expressions or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend variable names within lines of code, rather than the entire lines, that separate one cluster from another. Another modification would increase the interpretability of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend variables. Since the variable behavior is used to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalize }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalize }\DIFaddend variable names, the values of variables and sub-expressions during execution on a test case could be displayed just beneath or alongside the code, as demonstrated in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an experimental Python notebook ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{kevinkwokdemo}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Kevin Kwok's (unpublished) Python notebook demo}\DIFaddend , in addition to the way it is currently shown, as a legend mapping each variable name to its behavior beneath a tab that many user study subjects did not consult. 


%\todo{Interface upgrades: talk about beneath-line value annotation like that cool notebook and showing differences at the level of subexpressions, and filtering by sets of common variables in solutions which is like cheap version of lda on variables}

When the program tracing, renaming, or reformatting scripts generate an error while processing a solution, the solution is removed from the pipeline. This percentage of correct edX solutions that did not make it through the pipeline was less than five percent of solutions were excluded from each problem, but that can be reduced further by adding support for handling more special cases and language constructs to these library functions. As solutions get more complex, it will also be necessary to expand the OverCode pipeline to more gracefully handle user-created objects and helper functions. Complementary efforts, like ~\cite{choudhury2016autostyle}, also cannot yet handle more than a single function. This remains a difficult but important hurdle to expanding beyond introductory Python programming courses. As part of this expansion, it may be helpful to adopt the \texttt{observe} construct introduced by Gulwani et al.~\cite{gulwani_fse14} and support teacher annotation of solutions with the observe construct within the OverCode user interface. By soliciting human annotation of important variable values, two variables would not need to behave identically in order to be considered by OverCode as semantically the same.% reduces the need for variables

OverCode could also be integrated with the autograder that tests student solutions for input-output correctness. The execution could be performed once in such a way that it serves both systems, since both OverCode and many autograders require actually executing the code on specified test cases. If integrated into the autograder, teachers could give \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{`power feedback ' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{feedback }\DIFaddend by writing line- or stack-specific feedback to be sent to students alongside the input-output test results. The OverCode interface may also provide benefit to students, in addition to teaching staff, after students have solved the problem on their own. Cody is a standing example of the value of this kind of design/style feedback. However, the current interface may need to be adjusted for use by non-expert students, instead of teachers. %This would require pipeline and user interface modifications, in order to account for the fact that not all solutions would be returning the same values for each test case.

Simple interface enhancements would give teachers, and potentially students, more freedom to explore. For example, many user study subjects requested the ability to promote any cluster to be the reference cluster. A student might want to see their solution as the reference, at least as a starting point. Similar to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GroverCode's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the GroverCode }\DIFaddend sorting mechanism, the OverCode interface could support sorting clusters by their similarity to the reference as well as by cluster size.

\subsection{GroverCode}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GroverCode's canonicalization }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The normalization }\DIFaddend of incorrect solutions is based on heuristics about co-occurrences of syntax and variable behavior in both correct and incorrect solutions. This was an attempt to see how far the OverCode features could go toward \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalizing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing }\DIFaddend incorrect solutions in addition to correct solutions, without using any additional technology. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, there is pre-existing technology, i.e., }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend AutoGrader~\cite{autograder} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, that could }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{could also }\DIFaddend be added to the pipeline. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend The AutoGrader understands a language for expressing corrections in introductory Python programs. The authors created a list of such possible corrections\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and if applying }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. If }\DIFaddend a small subset of those corrections changes a solution's input-output behavior to match a reference solution, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the Autograder }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Autograder has diagnosed the bug(s) and }\DIFaddend can automatically correct the solution. It does not take into account which sets of corrections are more common, unlike the design philosophy the defines OverCode. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \todo{check this} %%%
\DIFdelend However, the corrections that are applied are guaranteed to convert the incorrect solutions into correct ones. The correct solutions can move through the OverCode pipeline to be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend and clustered without heuristics. 

If the AutoGrader is added to the pipeline, it will likely move some but not all solutions from the incorrect to the correct category. The corrections that have been automatically applied could be displayed alongside the corrected code in the GroverCode interface, for transparency. The GroverCode process for analyzing and displaying solutions that are still incorrect after being analyzed by the AutoGrader would be unchanged. If the language for expressing corrections is simple and expressive enough that it can be used by graders to write new rules while they are grading, the combined AutoGrader-OverCode pipeline could be rerun to correct any other yet ungraded solutions that are not already automatically corrected. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{There are also a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A }\DIFaddend variety of interface updates \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that have also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend been requested by the teachers who used GroverCode during live deployments\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, such as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.

}\DIFaddend 

\subsection{Foobaz}

%This is a step on a clear path toward user interfaces that allow teachers to give meaningful feedback to students at scale about a variety of at least partially subjective but important aspects of code. We believe that 
The approach taken in designing Foobaz may be generalizable to other aspects of programming style. Just as OverCode establishes the equivalency of variables based on their behavior during test cases, one could establish the behavior equivalency of larger or more abstract entities, such as student-written lines of code, sets of lines of code, or entire functions. We consider this a class of problems that Foobaz, and similar systems built after it, can tackle. Future iterations of Foobaz-inspired interfaces could also include additional constraints and affordances to encourage teachers to leave more explanations for their assessments, accompanied by better support for reusing common comments. Teachers could also be given the option to augment or overwrite existing labels, e.g., ``too short,'' to match their own preferences. %Finally, based on usage logs and Likert scale ratings on the helpfulness of various features, we will simplify the interface by removing unappreciated features and improve average response times by eliminating redundant computation.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The primarily difficulty of iterating on the two workflows, }\DIFdelend Dear Beta and Dear Gamma \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, that are collectively referred to in this thesis as ClassOverflow, is that they are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend most successful when \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{they are }\DIFdelend directly integrated into \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{teacher' s own systems and endorsed or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers' existing mandatory assignments or actively }\DIFaddend promoted by staff. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Sometimes the support is there, and sometimes it is not.

Therefore, a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process \cite{hdp} for learning these underlying design decisions may be a good model choice for this data. However, since some design decisions may be correlated with each other, it may be even more accurate to replace the (conveniently conjugate) Dirichlet prior with a (non-conjugate) logistic normal prior that can model correlated topics in addition to uncorrelated topics. This would be a non-parametric version of the Correlated Topic Model \cite{ctm}. If, as is likely, the chosen features can belong to multiple design decisions, it may be useful to add in elements of the Indian Buffett Process \cite{ibp}. Since (1) we do not know how many clusters will exist in the data ahead of time and (2) new solutions may introduce new clusters (there is no finite limit on the number of clusters as more solutions are received), models built on Dirichlet Processes are a good fit. Since solutions may contain multiple design decisions, it is preferable to be able to assign each of those design decisions separately, rather than assigning the entire solution to a cluster. HDPs are a good fit. If different design decisions share common features, IBPs may be an even better fit.Since the output of LDA and its infinite cousin, the HDP, can be difficult to interpret, BCM or MGM's optimizations for interpretability may make them more appropriate choices.Since teachers develop their own internal rubric for which differences matter and which do not, models which can incorporate and adjust based on feedback from the user, like iBCM, may be good model choices.Each of these models have favorable properties, and some properties can be super-imposed, while others are mutually exclusive. There is also previously ignored factors like the difficulty of implementing an inference algorithm for the model and the scalability and time requirements of running the chosen inference algorithm on the chosen representation of the solutions."}
