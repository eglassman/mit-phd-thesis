\chapter{Related Work}\label{chapter:relatedwork}

Systems that help students in massive programming courses may build on work from any or all the following related fields: program analysis, program synthesis, crowd workflows, user-interface design, machine learning, and learning science. This chapter presents prior work within these fields that this thesis builds on, such as theories of how people learn that inspired key design decisions. In order to clarify how this thesis is distinct and novel, this chapter also presents prior work that has similar goals or uses similar methods.

\section{Learning from Solution Variation}

\begin{comment}
Marton et al.'s variation theory \cite{Marton13} holds that in order to learn something, one must see examples that vary along particular dimensions: ``contrast,'' as in pairing it with something it is not; ``generalization,'' as in presenting multiple instances of the object or concept to be learned, varying only that which is irrelevant; ``separation,'' as in presenting multiple instances of the object or concept, varying only that which can vary internally without changing the object or concept into something else; and ``fusion,'' as in seeing multiple examples in which previously analytically separated aspects must be processed together to recognize the object or concept. The aspects which are related to these dimensions of variation and therefore define the object or concept are called ``critical features.''
\end{comment}

Marton's Variation Theory, as summarized by Suhonen et al. \cite{suhonen}, is defined by the dimensions of variation necessary to fully communicate a concept to a student: \emph{contrast} (``in order to experience something, a person must experience something else to compare it with''); \emph{generalization}, or the ways something can vary without becoming something else; \emph{separation}, or looking at the variation only across specific features; and \emph{fusion}, where multiple critical aspects of the concept are varied simultaneously. In other words, variation reveals which aspects of a phenomenon are superficial/irrelevant and which are innate/critical to its definition \cite{Leung}. These aspects that define the object or concept are called ``critical features.'' The Variation Theory is a framework that now guides the design of some critical reading exercises \cite{Tong} and exercises for novice programmers \cite{eckerdal}. 

Given Marton et al.'s rubric for effective patterns of variation, and the identification of ``critical features,'' one can discern between more or less theoretically effective examples of the object or concept given to a student to learn. On this basis, Luxton-Reilly et al. \cite{Luxton13} suggest that identifying distinct clusters of solutions can help instructors select appropriate examples of code for helping students learn. They also suggest that it is helpful for teachers' own understanding and quality of feedback and guidance. Facilitating the discovery or identification of critical features, which are possibly both teacher-specific and task-specific, is a major challenge I will address in this thesis. 

Other pedagogical strategies that involve comparing and contrasting examples have also been shown to have learning benefits. The pedagogical method of comparing and contrasting ways of approaching a solution has now been validated in the literature of mathematics education research \cite{Star07}, cognitive science \cite{loewenstein2003analogical,kurtz01learning,telling}, and computing education research \cite{Suhonen08, PatitsasICER13}. Peer reviews and assessments, surveyed in \cite{peerReview98}, are yet another opportunity for students to learn from compare and contrast.

\section{Methods for Extracting Solution Variation}

\begin{comment}
Braun and Clarke \cite{thematic06} argue that its application to qualitative data outside psychological research is justified. It is in direct contrast to methods in which a hypothesis or theory is first declared, and then evidence for and against it is gathered from the data. 
\end{comment}

Luxton-Reilly et al. \cite{Luxton13} used thematic analysis to capture the variation between correct solutions in their dataset. Thematic analysis comes out of the field of psychology as a way to build theory from observing patterns in organic, free-form statements from subjects, or, in this case, submissions for coding assignments. They aimed to discover the kinds and degree of variation between student-generated solutions that fulfilled the specifications of short introductory Java programming exercises. By thematic analysis of student submissions, the authors generated a taxonomy that captured the variation between correct solutions in their dataset. They then created an Eclipse plug-in for classifying new code examples based on their taxonomy.
