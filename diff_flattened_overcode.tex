\section{Introduction}

Intelligent tutoring systems (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ITSes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ITS}\DIFaddend ), Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and websites like Khan Academy and Codecademy are now used to teach programming courses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on }\DIFaddend a massive scale. In these courses, a single programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem }\DIFaddend may produce thousands of solutions from learners, which presents both an opportunity and a challenge. For teachers, the wide variation among these solutions can be a source of pedagogically valuable examples~\cite{marton13}, and understanding this variation is important for providing appropriate, tailored feedback to students~\cite{basupowergrading,MOOCshop}. The variation can also be useful for refining evaluation rubrics and exposing corner cases in automatic grading tests.

\label{overcode_fullinterface}
\end{figure*}

Sifting through thousands of solutions to understand their variation and find pedagogically valuable examples is a daunting task, even if the programming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exercises }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problems }\DIFaddend are simple and the solutions are only tens of lines of code long. Without tool support, a teacher may not read more than 50-100 of them before growing frustrated with the tedium of the task. Given this small sample size, teachers cannot be expected to develop a thorough understanding of the variety of strategies used to solve the problem, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or }\DIFdelend produce instructive feedback that is relevant to a large proportion of learners, or find unexpected interesting solutions.

An information visualization approach would enable teachers to explore the variation in solutions at scale. Existing techniques~\cite{gradingsigcse14,MOOCshop,codewebs} use a combination of clustering to group solutions that are semantically similar, and graph visualization to show the variation between these clusters. These clustering algorithms perform pairwise comparisons that are quadratic in both the number of solutions and in the size of each solution, which scales poorly to thousands of solutions. Graph visualization also struggles with how to label the graph node for a cluster, because it has been formed by a complex combination of code features. Without meaningful labels for clusters in the graph, the rich information \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the learners' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in student }\DIFaddend solutions is lost and the teacher's ability to understand variation is weakened.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In this paper we present }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter presents }\DIFaddend OverCode, a system for visualizing and exploring the variation in thousands of programming solutions. OverCode is designed to visualize correct solutions, in the sense that they already passed the automatic grading tests typically used in a programming class at scale. The autograder cannot offer any further feedback on these correct solutions, and yet there may still be good and bad variations on correct solutions that are pedagogically valuable to highlight and discuss. OverCode aims to help teachers understand solution variation so that they can provide appropriate feedback to students at scale.

OverCode uses a novel \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clustering technique that creates clusters of identical cleaned code, in time linear in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{human-interpretable solution clustering technique. The clustering process is linear in time with respect to }\DIFaddend both the number of solutions and the size of each solution. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution that represents each cluster }\DIFaddend is readable, executable, and describes every solution in that cluster \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.  The cleaned code is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in a deterministic way that accounts for both syntax and behavior on test cases. The platonic solutions are }\DIFaddend shown in a visualization that puts code front-and-center (Figure~\ref{overcode_fullinterface}). In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode, the teacher reads through code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode interface, teachers read through platonic }\DIFaddend solutions that each represent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an entire cluster of solutionsthat look and act the same}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{entire clusters of solutions}\DIFaddend . The differences between clusters are highlighted to help teachers discover and understand the variations among \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{submitted }\DIFdelend solutions. Clusters can be filtered by the lines of code within them.  Clusters can also be merged together with {\em rewrite rules} that collapse variations that the teacher decides are unimportant. 

A cluster in OverCode is a set of solutions that perform the same computations, but may use different variable names or statement order.  OverCode uses a lightweight dynamic analysis to generate clusters, which scales linearly with the number of solutions. It clusters solutions whose variables take the same sequence of values when executed on test inputs and whose set of constituent lines of code are syntactically the same. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend An important component of this analysis is to rename variables that behave the same across different solutions. The renaming of variables serves three main purposes. First, it lets teachers create a mental mapping between variable names and their behavior which is consistent across the entire set of solutions. This may reduce the cognitive load for a teacher to understand different solutions. Second, it helps clustering by reducing variation between similar solutions. Finally, it also helps make the remaining differences between different solutions more salient. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This chapter concludes by presenting }\DIFaddend two user studies with a total of 24 participants who each looked at thousands of solutions from an introductory programming MOOC, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we compared }\DIFdelend the OverCode interface \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is compared }\DIFaddend with a baseline interface that showed original unclustered solutions. When using OverCode, participants felt that they were able to develop a better high-level view of the students' understandings and misconceptions. While participants didn't necessarily read more lines of code in the OverCode interface than in the baseline, the code they did read came from clusters containing a greater percentage of all the submitted solutions. Participants also drafted mock class forum posts about common good and bad solutions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. These forum posts }\DIFaddend were relevant to more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{solutions (and the students who wrote them) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student solutions }\DIFaddend when using OverCode as compared to the baseline. 

\section{OverCode} \label{overcode}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We now describe the OverCode user interface. OverCode }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OverCode }\DIFaddend is an information visualization application for teachers to explore student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{program solutions. The OverCode interface allows the user to scroll, filter, and }\emph{\DIFdel{stack}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{solutions. OverCode }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solutions. OverCode }\DIFaddend uses the metaphor of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stacks to denote collections }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solutions stacked on top of each other to denote a cluster }\DIFaddend of similar solutions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, where each stack shows a }\emph{\DIFdel{cleaned}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{solution from the corresponding collection of identical cleaned solutionsit represents. 
These cleaned solutions have strategically renamed variables and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The top solution in the stack is the platonic solution that represents all the other solutions in the stack. The OverCode interface allows the teacher to scroll through, filter, and merge stacks of solutions. 
}

\DIFadd{The platonic solutions that represent stacks are normalized in a novel way. Specifically, they have standardized formatting, no comments, and variable names that reflect the most popular naming choices across all solutions. They }\DIFaddend can be filtered by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend lines of code they contain \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Cleaned solutions can also be rewritten when users compose andapply a }\emph{\DIFdel{rewrite rule}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{, which can eliminate differences between cleaned solutions and therefore combine stacks of cleaned solutions that have become identical. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and, through rewrite rules, modified and merged. They are the result of the normalization process applied to all student solutions in the OverCode analysis pipeline. %DIF > They can also be rewritten when teachers compose and apply \emph{rewrite rules}, which can eliminate differences between platonic solutions and therefore merge stacks that have become identical after the rewrite. 
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We iteratively designed and developed the OverCode interface based on continuous evaluation by the authors, feedback from teachers and peers, and by consulting principles from the information visualization literature. }\DIFdelend %DIF > The OverCode interface was iteratively designed and developed based on continuous evaluation by the authors, feedback from teachers and peers, and by consulting principles from the information visualization literature. 
A screenshot of OverCode visualizing \codevar{iterPower}, one of the problems from our dataset, is shown in Figure~\ref{overcode_fullinterface}. In this section, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we describe }\DIFdelend the intended use cases and the user interface \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are described}\DIFaddend . In Section \ref{pipeline}, the backend program analysis pipeline is described in detail. 
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsection{Target Users and Applications}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsection{Target Users and Tasks}
\DIFaddend The target users of OverCode are teaching staff of introductory programming courses. Teaching staff may be undergraduate lab assistants who help students debug their code; graduate students who grade assignments, help students debug, and manage recitations and course forums; and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lecturing professors who also compose the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{instructors who compose }\DIFaddend major course assessments. Teachers using OverCode may be looking for common misconceptions, creating a grading rubric, or choosing pedagogically valuable examples to review with students in a future lesson.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsubsection{Misconceptions and Holes in Students' Knowledge}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{Misconceptions and Holes in Student Knowledge}
\DIFaddend Students just starting to learn programming can have a difficult time understanding the language constructs and different API methods. They may use them suboptimally, or in non-standard ways. OverCode may help instructors identify these common misconceptions and holes in knowledge, by highlighting the differences between stacks of solutions. Since the visualized solutions have already been tested and found correct by an autograder, these highlighted differences between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions may be convoluted variations in construct usage and API method choices that have not been flagged by the Python interpreter or caused the failure of a unit test. Convoluted code may suggest a misconception.

\DIFaddbegin \todo{Rob: it would be great to show example code for these tasks, ideally showing them in OverCode -- can you mine any examples from your thesis defense talk?}

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Grading Rubrics}
It is a difficult task to create grading rubrics for checking properties such as design and style of solutions. Therefore most autograders resort to checking only functional correctness of solutions by testing them against a test suite of input-output pairs. OverCode enables teachers to identify the style, structure, and relative frequency of the variation within correct solutions. Unlike traditional ways of creating a grading rubric, where an instructor may go through a set of solutions, revising the rubric along the way, instructors can use OverCode to first get a high-level overview of the variations before designing a corresponding rubric. Teachers may also see incorrect solutions not caught by the autograder.

\subsubsection{Pedagogically Valuable Examples} 
There can be a variety of ways to solve a given problem and express it in code. If an assignment allows students to generate different solutions, e.g., recursive or iterative, to fulfill the same input-output behavior, OverCode will show separate stacks for each of these different solutions, as well as stacks for every variant of those solutions. OverCode helps teachers filter through solutions to find different examples of solutions to the same problem, which may be pedagogically valuable. According to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Variation Theory }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variation theory }\DIFaddend ~\cite{marton13}, students can learn through concrete examples of these multiple solutions, which vary along \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{various }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{different }\DIFaddend conceptual dimensions.
\subsection{User Interface}

The OverCode user interface is the product of an iterative design process with multiple stages, including paper prototypes and low-fidelity \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{web-browser-based prototypes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{prototypes rendered in a web browser}\DIFaddend .  Prototype iterations were used and critiqued by members of our research group and by several teaching staff of an introductory Python programming course. While exploring the low-fidelity prototypes, these teachers talked aloud about their hopes for what the tool could do, frustrations with its current form, and their frustrations with existing solution-viewing tools and processes. This feedback was incorporated into the final design.

The OverCode user interface is divided into three columns. The top-left panel in the first column shows the problem name, the \emph{done} progress bar, the number of stacks, the number of visualized stacks given the current filters and rewrite rules, and the total number of solutions those visualized stacks contain. The panel below shows the largest stack \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that represents the most common solution}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of solutions}\DIFaddend . Side by side with the largest stack, the remaining \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{solution }\DIFdelend stacks appear in the second panel. Through scrolling, any stack can be horizontally aligned with the largest stack for easier comparison. The third panel has three different tabs that provide static and dynamic information about the solutions, and the ability to filter and combine stacks. 

As shown in Figure~\ref{overcode_fullinterface}, the default tab shows a list of lines of code that occur in different \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions together with their corresponding frequencies. The stacks can be filtered based on the occurrence of one or more lines (Filter tab). The column also has tabs for \emph{Rewrite} and \emph{Legend}. The Rewrite tab allows a teacher to provide rewrite rules to collapse different stacks with small differences into a larger single stack. The Legend tab shows the dynamic values that different program variables take during the execution of programs over a test case. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We now describe different features of OverCode in more detail.

\DIFaddend 

\subsubsection{Stacks} A stack in OverCode denotes a set of similar solutions that are grouped together based on a similarity criterion defined in Section \ref{pipeline}. For example, a stack for the \codevar{iterPower} problem is shown in Figure~\ref{stacks}(a). The size of each stack\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, i.e., the number of solutions in a stack, }\DIFaddend is shown in a pillbox at the top-left corner of the stack. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The count denotes how many solutions are in the stack, and can also be referred to as the stack }%DIFDELCMD < {\it %%%
\DIFdel{size}%DIFDELCMD < }%%%
\DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend Stacks are listed in the scrollable second panel from largest to smallest. The solution on the top of the stack is a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solution that describes all the solutions in the stack. See Section \ref{pipeline} for details on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaning process }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing process that produces platonic solutions}\DIFaddend .

Each stack can also be clicked. After clicking a stack, the border color of the stack changes and the \emph{done} progress bar is updated to reflect the percentage of total solutions clicked, as shown in Figure~\ref{stacks}(b). This feature is intended to help \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend remember which stacks they have already read or analyzed, and keep track of their progress. Clicking on a large stack, which represents a significant fraction of the total solutions, is reflected by a large change in the \emph{done} progress bar. \DIFaddbegin \todo{add that now the raw solutions inside the stack are also displayed, but this was not included during user study tests}
\DIFaddend

\label{stacks}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Showing Differences between Stacks} OverCode allows teachers to compare smaller stacks, shown in the second column, with the largest stack, shown in the first column. The lines of code in the second column that also appear in the set of lines in the largest stack are dimmed so that only the differences between the smaller stacks and the largest stack are apparent. For example, Figure~\ref{stackdifferences} shows the differences between the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions of the two largest stacks. In earlier iterations of the user interface, lines in stacks that were not shared with the largest stack were highlighted in yellow, but this produced a lot of visual noise. By dimming the lines in stacks that \textit{are} shared with the largest stack, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we reduced }\DIFdelend the visible noise \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is reduced}\DIFaddend , while still keeping differences between stacks salient.

\begin{figure*}

\includegraphics[scale=0.42]{Body/figures/overcode/lineFadingScreenshot}
\caption{Similar lines of code between two stacks are dimmed out such that only differences between the two stacks are apparent.}
\label{stackdifferences}
\end{figure*}



\subsubsection{Filtering Stacks by Lines of Code} The third column of OverCode shows the list of lines of code occurring in the solutions together with their frequencies (numbered pillboxes). The interface has a slider that can be used to change the threshold value, which denotes the number of solutions in which a line should appear for it to be included in the list. For example, by dragging the slider to $200$ in Figure~\ref{linefilter}(a), OverCode only shows lines of code that are present in at least $200$ solutions. This feature was added as a response to the length of the unfiltered list of code lines, which was long enough to make skimming for common code lines difficult.

Users can filter the stacks by selecting one or more lines of code from the list. After each selection, only stacks whose \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions have those selected lines of code are shown. Figure~\ref{linefilter}(b) shows a filtering of stacks that have a \codevar{for} loop, specifically the line of code \codevar{for i in range(expB)}, and that assign $1$ to the variable \codevar{result}.

\caption{(a) The slider allows filtering of the list of lines of code by the number of solutions in which they appear. (b) Clicking on a line of code adds it to the list of lines by which the stacks are filtered.}
\label{linefilter}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Rewrite Rules} There are often small differences between the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions that can lead to a large number of stacks for a teacher to review. OverCode provides \emph{rewrite rules} by which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend can collapse these differences and ignore variation they do not need to see. This feature comes from experience with early prototypes. After observing a difference between stacks, like the use of \codevar{xrange} instead of \codevar{range}, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teachers }\DIFaddend wanted to ignore that difference in order to more easily find other differences.

A rewrite rule is described with a left hand side and a right hand side as shown in Figure~\ref{rewriterule}(a). The semantics of a rewrite rule is to replace all occurrences of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{left hand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{left-hand }\DIFaddend side expression in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions with the corresponding \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{right hand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{right-hand }\DIFaddend side. As the rewrite rules are entered, OverCode presents a preview of the changes in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions as shown in Figure~\ref{rewriterule}(b). After the application of the rewrite rules, OverCode collapses stacks that now have the same \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions because of the rewrites. For example, after the application of the rewrite rule in Figure~\ref{rewriterule}(a), OverCode collapses the two biggest iterPower stacks from Figure~\ref{overcode_fullinterface} of sizes $1534$ and $374$, respectively, into a single stack of size $1908$. Other pairs of stacks whose differences have now been removed by the rewrite rule are also collapsed into single stacks. As shown in Figure~\ref{afterrewrite}(a), the number of stacks now drop from $862$ to $814$.

\label{afterrewrite}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Variable Legends} OverCode also shows the sequence of values that variables in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions take on, over the course of their execution on a test case. As described in Section~\ref{pipeline}, a variable is identified by the sequence of values it takes on during the execution of the test case. Figure~\ref{afterrewrite}(b) shows a snapshot of the variable values for the \codevar{iterPower} problem. The goal of presenting this dynamic information associated with common variable names is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to help users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{intended to help teachers (1) }\DIFaddend understand the behavior of each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned solution , and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution without having to mentally execute it on a test case and (2) }\DIFaddend further explore the variations among solutions that do not have the same common variables. When this legend was originally added to the user interface, clicking on a common variable name would filter for all solutions that contained an instance of that variable. Some pilot users found this feature confusing, rather than empowering. As a result, it was removed from OverCode before running both user studies. At least one study participant, upon realizing the value of the legend, wished that the original click-to-filter-by-variable functionality existed; it may be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{re-instated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reinstated }\DIFaddend in future versions.

\section{Implementation} \label{pipeline}
The OverCode user interface depends on an analysis pipeline that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalizes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizes }\DIFaddend solutions in a manner designed for human readability\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, referred to here as }\emph{\DIFdel{cleaning}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend . The pipeline then creates stacks of solutions that have become identical through the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaning }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing }\DIFaddend process. The pipeline accepts, as input, a set of solutions, expressed as function definitions for $f(a,...)$, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one test case $f(a_{1},...)$. We refer to the solutions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a set of test cases. Solutions }\DIFaddend that enter the pipeline \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are referred to }\DIFaddend as \emph{raw}, and the solutions that exit the pipeline as \emph{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clean}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal}\DIFaddend }. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To illustrate this pipeline, we will have a few running examples, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Examples, }\DIFaddend beginning with \codevar{iterPower}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, are presented below to illustrate this pipeline}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Analysis Pipeline}
OverCode is currently implemented for Python, but the pipeline steps described below could be readily generalized to other languages commonly used to teach programming.

{\bf 1. Reformat solutions.} For a consistent appearance, the solutions are reformatted \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with the PythonTidy package}\DIFaddend \footnote{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We used the PythonTidy package, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Created }\DIFaddend by Charles Curtis Rhode. \url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy/}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since our datasets are in Python, we use a Python-specific reformatting script. However, our approach is not language-specific.}\DIFdelend } to have consistent line indentation and token spacing. Comments and empty lines are also removed. These steps not only make solutions more readable, but also allow exact string matches between solutions, after additional \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaning }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing }\DIFaddend steps later in the pipeline. Although comments can contain valuable information, the variation in comments is so great that clustering and summarizing them will require significant additional design, which remains future work. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

{\bf 2. Execute solutions.} Each solution is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{executed once, using }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on }\DIFaddend the same test case\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(s)}\DIFaddend . During each step of the execution \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for each test case}\DIFaddend , the names and values of local and global variables, and also return values from functions, are recorded as a program trace \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using an adaptation of Philip Guo's logger~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{pgbovineOPT}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . There is one program trace per solution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. For the purposes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{per test case.

{\bf 3. Extract variable sequences.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{During the previous step, the Python execution logger \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{pgbovineOPT} }%DIFAUXCMD
records the values of all in-scope variables after every statement execution in the Python program. The resulting log is referred to as the program trace. }\DIFdelend For each variable in a program trace, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we extract the sequence of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the pipeline extracts the sequence of distinct }\DIFaddend values it takes on\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Figure~\ref{fig:extractsequence} shows the program trace for a solution run on a test case, as well as the extracted sequences of distinct values for each variable. Variable sequence extraction also works for purely functional programs, in which variables are never reassigned, because each recursive invocation is treated as if new values are given to its parameter variables. For example, in spite of the fact that the }\codevar{iterPower} \DIFadd{problem asked students to compute the exponential $\codevar{base}^\codevar{exp}$ }\textit{\DIFadd{iteratively}}\DIFaddend , \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{without considering how many statements were executed before the variable 's value changed.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The pipeline compares sets }\DIFaddend of lines of code because then solutions with arbitrarily ordered lines that do not depend on each other can still fall into the same stack.

The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solution that represents the stack is randomly chosen from within the stack, because all the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clean }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend solutions within the stack are identical, with the possible exception of the order of their statements. 

In the examples \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{below, the clean }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in Figure~\ref{fig:makingstacks}, the normal }\DIFaddend C and D solutions have the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exact }\DIFdelend same set of lines, and both provide correct output, with respect to the autograder.

}

\DIFadd{This logging of solution execution can be one of the longer steps in the OverCode analysis pipeline, so preprocessing occurs once per solution and is saved in its own pickle file. New solutions can be preprocessed once, without affecting previously preprocessed solutions. Batch processing takes, as input, all the existing preprocessed results and normalizes variable names. This must occur as a batch operation because variable renaming depends on the behavior and name of every variable in every solution.
}

\DIFadd{The program }\DIFaddend tracing \cite{pgbovineOPT} and renaming scripts occasionally generate errors while processing a solution. For example, the script may not have code to handle a particular but rare Python construct. Errors thrown by the scripts drive their development and are helpful for debugging. When errors occur while processing a particular solution, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we exclude the solution }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they are excluded }\DIFaddend from our analysis. Less than five percent of the solutions in each of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend three problem datasets are excluded.

\subsection{Variable Renaming Details and Limitations} \label{repercussions}

There are three distinct types of name collisions possible when renaming variables to be consistent across multiple solutions. The first, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which we refer to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{referred to here }\DIFaddend as a {\it common/common} collision, occurs when two common variables (with different variable sequences) have the same common name. The second, referred to here as a {\it multiple instances} collision, occurs when there are multiple different instances of the same common variable in a solution. The third and final collision, referred to as a {\it unique/common} collision, occurs when a unique variable's name collides with a common variable's name.

{\bf Common/common collision.} If common variables $cv_{1}$ and $cv_{2}$ are both most frequently named $i$ across all program traces, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we append }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the pipeline appends }\DIFaddend a modifier to the name of the less frequently used common variable. For example, if 500 program traces have an instance of $cv_{1}$ and only 250 program traces have an instance of $cv_{2}$, $cv_{1}$ will be named $i$ and $cv_{2}$ will be named $iB$.  

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is illustrated below. Across all thousand of }%DIFDELCMD < \codevar{iterPower} %%%
\DIFdel{definitions in our dataset}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For example}\DIFaddend , a subset of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{them }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \codevar{iterPower} \DIFadd{solutions }\DIFaddend created a variable that iterated through the values generated by \codevar{range(exp)}. Student A's code is an example. A smaller subset created a variable that iterated through the values generated by \codevar{range(1,exp+1)}, as seen in Student E's code. These are two separate common variables in our pipeline, due to their differing value sequences. The {\it common/common} name collision arises because both common variables are most frequently named \codevar{i} across all solutions to \codevar{iterPower}. To preserve the one-to-one mapping of variable name to value sequence across the entire \codevar{iterPower} problem dataset, the pipeline appends a modifier, \codevar{B}, to the common variable \codevar{i} found in fewer \codevar{iterPower} solutions. A common variable, also most commonly named \codevar{i}, which is found in even fewer \codevar{iterPower} definitions, will have a \codevar{C} appended, etc. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:commcommcoll}.

{\bf Multiple-instances collision.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We identify }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The pipeline identifies }\DIFaddend variables by their sequence of values (excluding consecutive duplicates), not by their given name in any particular solution. However, without considering the timing of variables' transitions between values, relative to other variables in scope at each step of a function execution, it is not possible to differentiate between multiple instances of a common variable within a single solution. 

Rather than injecting a name collision into an otherwise correct solution, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we chose to preserve the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the pipeline preserves the solution }\DIFaddend author's variable name choice for all the instances of that common variable in that solution. If \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a solution }\DIFaddend author's preserved variable name collides with any common variable name in any program trace and does not share that common variable's sequence of values, the pipeline appends a double underscore to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{authors }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solution author's }\DIFaddend preserved variable name, so that the interface, and the human reader, do not conflate them.

In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the following example}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure~\ref{fig:multiinst}}\DIFaddend , the solution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend author made a copy of the \codevar{exp} variable, called it \codevar{exp1}, and modified neither. Both map to the same common variable, \codevar{expB}. Therefore, both have had their author-given names preserved, with an underscore appended to the local \codevar{exp} so it does not look like common variable \codevar{exp}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Unlike previous }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Clustering methods that use }\DIFaddend pairwise AST edit \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distance-based clustering approaches that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distance metrics }\DIFaddend have quadratic complexity both in the number of solutions and the size of the ASTs~\cite{MOOCshop}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The OverCode }\DIFaddend analysis pipeline has linear complexity in the number of solutions and in the size of the ASTs. The Reformat step performs a single pass over each solution for removing extra spaces, comments, and empty lines. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since we only consider correct solutions , we assume that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Given the assumption that all solutions in the pipeline are correct, }\DIFaddend each solution can be executed within a constant time that is independent of the number of solutions. The executions performed by the autograder for checking correctness could also be instrumented to obtain the program traces, so code is not unnecessarily re-executed. The identification of all common variables and unique variables across the program traces takes linear time as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we can hash }\DIFdelend the corresponding variable sequences \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and then check }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can be hashed and then checked }\DIFaddend for occurrences of identical sequences. The Renaming step, which includes handling name collisions, also performs a single pass over each solution. Finally, the Stacking step creates stacks of similar solutions by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{performing set-based equalityof lines of code that can also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{testing set equality, which can }\DIFaddend be performed in linear time by hashing the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{set of lines of code}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sets}\DIFaddend .


\section{Dataset} \label{dataset}

For evaluating both the analysis pipeline and the user interface of OverCode, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we use a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend dataset of solutions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is collected }\DIFaddend from 6.00x, an introductory programming course in Python that was offered on edX in fall 2012. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We chose Python solutions from three exercise problems , and this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Three exercise problems were chosen. This }\DIFaddend dataset consists of student solutions submitted within two weeks of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the posting of the those three problems. We obtained thousands of submissions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{each problem's release date. There are thousands of solutions }\DIFaddend to these problems \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the dataset}\DIFaddend , from which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we selected }\DIFdelend all correct solutions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend tested over a set of test cases\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) for our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, were selected for }\DIFaddend analysis. The number of solutions analyzed for each problem is shown in Figure~\ref{overcode_solutioncounttable}.



%\caption{Our dataset of problems from an introductory programming course in Python, from Fall 2012.}
%\label{table-edx-probs}

 \begin{itemize} 
\item {\bf \codevar{iterPower}} The \codevar{iterPower} problem asks students to write a function to compute the exponential $\codevar{base}^\codevar{exp}$ iteratively using successive multiplications. This was an in-lecture exercise for the lecture on teaching iteration. See Figure \ref{ipexamples} for examples.
\item {\bf \codevar{hangman}} The \codevar{hangman} problem takes a string \codevar{secretWord} and a list of characters \codevar{lettersGuessed} as input, and asks students to write a function that returns a string where all letters in \codevar{secretWord} that are not present in the list \codevar{lettersGuessed} are replaced with an underscore. This was a part of the third week of problem set exercises. See Figure \ref{hmexamples} for examples.
\item {\bf \codevar{compDeriv}} The \codevar{compDeriv} problem requires students to write a Python function to compute the derivative of a polynomial, where the coefficients of the polynomial are represented as a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{python }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Python }\DIFaddend list. This was also a part of the third week of problem set exercises. See Figure \ref{cdexamples} for examples.
 \end{itemize} 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We chose these three exercises for our dataset }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The three exercises were selected for analysis }\DIFaddend because they are representative of the typical exercises students solve in the early weeks of an introductory programming course. The three exercises have varying levels of complexity and ask students to perform loop computation over three fundamental Python data types, integers (\codevar{iterPower}), strings (\codevar{hangman}), and lists (\codevar{compDeriv}). The exercises span the second and third weeks of the course in which they were assigned.

\section{OverCode Analysis Pipeline Evaluation}
We now present the evaluation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode }\DIFaddend analysis pipeline implementation on our Python dataset. We first present the running time of our algorithm and show that it can generate stacks within \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend few minutes for each problem on a laptop. We then present the distribution of initial stack sizes generated by the pipeline. Finally, we present some examples of the common variables identified by the pipeline and report on the number of cases where name collisions are handled during the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaning }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalizing }\DIFaddend process. The evaluation was performed on a Macbook Pro 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM. %DIF > \todo{remove we's} 

{\bf Running Time} The complexity of the pipeline that generates stacks of solutions grows linearly in the number of solutions as described in Section~\ref{complexity}. Figure~\ref{backendevaluation} reports the running time of the pipeline on the problems in the dataset as well as the number of stacks and the number of common variables found across each of the problems. As can be seen from the Figure, the pipeline is able to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clean }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalize }\DIFaddend thousands of student solutions and generate stacks within \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend few minutes for each problem.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Running time and the number of stacks and common variables generated by the OverCode backend implementation on our dataset problems.}
\label{backendevaluation}
\end{figure*}

{\bf Distribution of Stacks} The distribution of initial stack sizes generated by the analysis pipeline for different problems is shown in Figure~\ref{stackdistribution}. Note that the two axes of the graph corresponding to the size and the number of stacks are shown on a logarithmic scale. For each problem, we observe that there are a few large stacks and a lot of smaller stacks (particularly of size 1). The largest stack for \codevar{iterPower} problem consists of $1534$ solutions, while the largest stacks for \codevar{hangman} and \codevar{compDeriv} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consists }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{consist }\DIFaddend of $97$ and $22$ solutions\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend respectively. The two largest stacks \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with the corresponding cleaned solutions }\DIFdelend for each problem are shown in Figure~\ref{toptwostacks}. 

The number of stacks consisting of a single solution for \codevar{iterPower}, \codevar{hangman}, and \codevar{compDeriv} are $684$, $452$, and $959$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend respectively. Some singleton stacks are the same as one of the largest stacks, except for a unique choice, such as initializing a variable using several \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{additional }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{more }\DIFaddend significant digits than necessary: \codevar{result=1.000} instead of \codevar{result=1} or \codevar{result=1.0}. Other singleton stacks have convoluted control flow that no other student used. 

These variations are compounded by inclusion of unnecessary statements that do not affect input-output behavior. An existing stack may have all the same lines of code except for the unnecessary line(s), which cause the solution to instead be a singleton. These unnecessary lines may reveal misconceptions, and therefore are potentially interesting to teachers. In future versions, rewrite rules may be expanded to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{allow }\DIFdelend include line removal rules, so that teachers can remove inconsequential extra lines and cause singleton(s) to merge with other stacks. 

The tail of singleton solutions is long, and cannot be read in its entirety by teachers. Even so, the user studies indicate that teachers still extracted significant value from OverCode presentation of solutions. It may be that the largest stacks are the primary sources of information, and singletons can be ignored without a significant effect on the value teachers get from OverCode. Future work will explore ways to suggest rewrite and removal rules that maximally collapse stacks.

{\bf Common Variables} There exists a large variation among the variable names used by students to denote variables that compute the same set of values. The Variable Renaming step of the analysis renames these equivalent variables with the most frequently chosen variable name so that a teacher can easily recognize the role of variables in a given solution. The number of common variables found by the pipeline on the dataset problems is shown in Figure~\ref{backendevaluation} and some examples of these common variable names are shown in Figure~\ref{examplecommonvars}. Figure~\ref{examplecommonvars} also presents the number of times such a variable occurs across the solutions of a given problem, the corresponding variable sequence value on a given test input, and a subset of the original variable names used in the student solutions.

\end{figure}

{\bf Collisions in Variable Renaming} The number of Common/Common, Multiple Instances, and Unique/Common collisions discovered and resolved while performing variable renaming is shown in Figure~\ref{collisions}. A large majority of the collisions were Common/Common Collisions. For example, Figure~\ref{examplecommonvars} shows the common variable name \codevar{exp} for two different sequences of values $[3,2,1,0]$ and $[3]$ for the \codevar{iterPower} problem. Similarly, the common variable name \codevar{i} corresponds to sequences $[-13.9, 0.0, 17.5, 3.0, 1.0$ and $[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ for the \codevar{compDeriv} problem. There were also a few Multiple Instances collisions and Unique/Common collisions found: 1.5\% for \codevar{iterPower}, 3\% for \codevar{compDeriv}, and 10\% for \codevar{hangman}.

\DIFdel{Our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \section{User Studies}

\DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend goal was to design a system that allows teachers to develop a better understanding of the variation in student solutions, and give feedback that is relevant to more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' solutions. We designed two user studies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student solutions. Two user studies were designed }\DIFaddend to evaluate our progress in two ways: (1) user interface satisfaction and (2) how many solutions teachers could read and produce feedback on in a fixed amount of time. Reading and providing feedback to thousands of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{submissions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solutions }\DIFaddend is an unrealistically difficult task for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend control condition, so instead of measuring time to finish the entire set of solutions, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we sought to measure what our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the experiment measures what }\DIFaddend subjects could accomplish in a fixed amount of time (15 minutes).

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Together, these studies test four hypotheses:
} \begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{\DIFadd{H1 Interface Satisfaction}} \DIFadd{Subjects will find OverCode easier to use, more helpful and less overwhelming for browsing thousands of solutions, compared to the baseline. 
}

\item {\bf \DIFadd{H2 Read coverage and speed}} \DIFadd{Subjects are able to read code that represents more student solutions at a higher rate using OverCode than with the baseline. 
}

\item {\bf \DIFadd{H3 Feedback coverage}} \DIFadd{Feedback produced when using OverCode is relevant to more student solutions than when feedback is produced using the baseline.
}

\item {\bf \DIFadd{H4 Perceived coverage}} \DIFadd{Subjects feel that they develop a better high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions, and provide more relevant feedback using OverCode than with the baseline.
}

 \end{itemize} 

\subsection{User Study 1: Writing a Class Forum Post}

\DIFaddend The first study was a 12-person within-subjects evaluation of interface satisfaction when using OverCode for a realistic, relatively unstructured task. Using either OverCode or a baseline interface, subjects were asked to browse student solutions to the programming problems in our dataset and then write a class forum post on the good and bad ways students solved the problem. Through this study, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we sought to test our first hypothesis :

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{OverCode and Baseline Interfaces}
\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We designed two interfaces }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Two interfaces were designed}\DIFaddend , referred to here as OverCode and the baseline. The OverCode interface and backend are described in detail in Section \ref{overcode}. The baseline interface was a single webpage with all student solutions concatenated in a random order into a flat list (Figure \ref{iterPowerEdXControl}, left). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We chose this design to emulate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This design emulates }\DIFaddend existing methods of reviewing solutions, and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{aims }\DIFaddend to draw out differences between browsing stacked and unstacked solutions. This is analogous to the ``flat'' interface chosen as a baseline for Basu et al.'s interface for grading clusters of short answers~\cite{basuDivideAndConquer}. Basu et al.'s assumption, that existing options for reviewing solutions are limited to going through solutions one-by-one, is backed by our pilot studies and interviews with teaching staff, and our own grading experiences. In fact, in edX programming MOOCs, teachers are not even provided with an interface for viewing all solutions at once\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; they }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. They }\DIFaddend can only look at one student \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend solution at a time.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We recruited participants }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{Participants}

\DIFadd{Participants were recruited }\DIFaddend by reaching out to past and present programming course staff \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at our university}\DIFaddend , and advertising on an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{academic computer science research lab's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MIT CSAIL }\DIFaddend email list. These individuals were qualified to participate in our study because they met at least one of the following requirements: (1) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were current teaching staff of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have taught }\DIFaddend a computer science course (2) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{had }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend graded Python code before, or (3) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{had }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend significant Python programming experience, making them potential future teaching staff. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Subjects were offered \$20 to participate. 
}\DIFaddend 

Information about the subjects' backgrounds was collected during recruitment and again at the beginning of their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one hour }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one-hour }\DIFaddend in-lab user study session. 12 people (7 male) participated, with a mean age of 23.5 ($\sigma = 3.8$). Subjects had a mean 4 years of Python programming experience ($\sigma = 1.8$), and $75\%$ of participants had graded student solutions written in Python before.

\DIFdelend 

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{Conditions}

\DIFaddend Subjects performed the main task of browsing solutions and writing a class forum post twice, once in each interface condition, focusing on one of the three problems in our dataset (Section \ref{dataset}) each time. For each participant, the third remaining problem was used during training, to reduce learning effects when performing the two main tasks. The pairing and ordering of interface and problem conditions were fully counterbalanced, resulting in 12 total conditions. The twelve participants were randomly assigned to one of the 12 conditions, such that all conditions were tested.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{Procedure}
\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsubsection{Prompt}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Prompt}} \DIFaddend The experimenter began by reading the following prompt, to give the participant context for the tasks they would be performing:

\begin{quote}

We want to help TAs [teaching assistants] give feedback to students in programming classes at scale. For each of three problems, we have a large set of students' submissions ($> 1000$). 

All the submissions are correct, in terms of input and output behavior. We're going to ask you to browse the submissions and produce feedback for students in the class. You'll do this primarily in the form of a class forum post.
\end{quote}

To make the task more concrete, participants were given an example\footnote{Our example was drawn from the blog ``Practice Python: 30-minute weekly Python exercises for beginners,'' posted on Thursday, April 24, 2014, and titled ``SOLUTION Exercise 11: Check Primality and Functions.'' (\url{http://practicepython.blogspot.com})} of a class forum post that used examples taken from student solutions to explain different strategies for solving a Python problem. They were also given print-outs of the prompts for each of the three problems in our dataset, to reference when looking at solutions.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsubsection{Training}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend 

\DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Training}} \DIFaddend Given the subjects' extensive experience with web-browsers, training for the baseline interface was minimal. Prior to using the OverCode interface, subjects watched a 3-4 minute long training video demonstrating the features of OverCode, and were given an opportunity to become familiar with the interface and ask questions. The training session focused on the problem that would not be used in the main tasks, in order to avoid learning effects.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsubsection{Tasks}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Tasks}} \DIFaddend Subjects then performed the main tasks twice, once in each interface, focusing on a different programming problem each time. They were given a fixed amount of time to both read solutions and provide feedback, so \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we did not measure }\DIFdelend task completion times \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were not measured}\DIFaddend , but instead the quality of their experience in providing feedback to students at scale.

 \begin{itemize} 
\item {\it Feedback for Students} (15 minutes) Subjects were asked to write a class forum post on the good and bad ways students solved the problem. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fifteen minute }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{15-minute }\DIFaddend period included both browsing and writing time, as subjects were free to paste in code examples and write comments as they browsed the solutions.

\item {\it Autograder Bugs} (2 min) Although the datasets of student solutions were marked as correct by an autograder, there may be holes in the autograder \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend test cases. Some solutions may deviate from the problem prompt, and therefore be considered incorrect by teachers, e.g., recursive solutions to \codevar{iterPower} when its prompt explicitly calls for an iterative solution. As a secondary task, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we asked subjects }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subjects were asked }\DIFaddend to write down any bugs in the autograder they came across while browsing solutions. This was often performed concurrently with the primary task by the subject.
 \end{itemize} 
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsubsection{Surveys}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Surveys}} \DIFaddend Subjects filled out a post-interface condition survey about their experience using the interface. This was a short-answer survey, where they wrote about what they liked, what they did not like, and what they would like to see in a future version of the interface. At the end of the study, subjects rated agreement (on a 7-point Likert scale) with statements about their satisfaction with each interface.

After using both interfaces to view thousands of solutions, subjects found OverCode easier to use (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{W=52, Z=2.41, p<0.05, r=0.70}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W=52, Z=2.41, p<0.05, r=0.70$}\DIFaddend ) and less overwhelming (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{W = 0, Z = -2.86, p < 0.005, r = 0.83}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W=0, Z=-2.86, p<0.005, r=0.83$}\DIFaddend ) than the baseline interface. Finally, participants felt that OverCode ``helped me get a better sense of my students' understanding'' than the baseline did (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{W = 66, Z = 3.04, p < 0.001, r = 0.88). }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W=66, Z=3.04, p<0.001, r=0.88$).

\end{figure}


From the surveys conducted after subjects completed each interface condition, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we found that }\DIFdelend subjects found stacking and the ability to rewrite code to be useful and enjoyable features of OverCode:
 \begin{itemize} 
\item \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFaddend Stacking is an awesome feature. Rewrite tool is fantastic. Done feature is very rewarding--feels much less overwhelming. "Lines that appear in x submissions" also awesome.\DIFaddbegin }
\DIFaddend 

\item \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFaddend Really liked the clever approach for variable normalization. Also liked the fact that stacks showed numbers, so I'd know I'm focusing on the highest-impact submissions. Impressed by the rewrite ability... it cut down on work so much!\DIFaddbegin }
\DIFaddend 

\item \DIFaddbegin {\it \DIFaddend I liked having solutions collapsed (not having to deal with variable names, etc), and having rules to allow me to collapse even further. This made it easy to see the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"plurality" }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``plurality'' }\DIFaddend of solutions right away; I spent most of the time looking at the solutions that only had a few instances.\DIFaddbegin }
\DIFaddend  \end{itemize} 

When asked for suggestions, participants gave many suggestions on stacks, filtering, and rewrite rules, such as:
 \begin{itemize} 
\item Enable the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{user }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher }\DIFaddend to change the main stack that is being compared against the others.
\item Suggest possible rewrite rules, based on what the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{user }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher }\DIFaddend has already written, and will not affect the answers on the test case.
\item Create a filter that shows all stacks that do {\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \emph %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \it \DIFaddend not} have a particular statement.
 \end{itemize} 

For both the OverCode and baseline interfaces, the feedback generated about \codevar{iterPower}, \codevar{hangman}, and \codevar{compDeriv} solutions fell into several common themes. One kind of feedback suggested new language features, such as using \codevar{*=} or the keyword \codevar{in}. Another theme identified inefficient, redundant, and convoluted control flow, such as repeated statements and unnecessary statements and variables. It was not always clear what the misconception was, though, as one participant wrote, \textit{``The double iterator solution surely shows some lack of grasp of power of for loop, or range, or something.''} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Participants' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Participant }\DIFaddend feedback included comments on the relative goodness of different correct solutions in the dataset. This was a more holistic look at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend solutions as they varied along the dimensions of conciseness, clarity, and efficiency previously described.

Study participants found both noteworthy correct solutions and solutions they considered incorrect, despite passing the autograder. One participant learned a new Python function, \codevar{enumerate}, while looking at a solution that used it. The participant wrote, \textit{``Cool, but uncalled for. I had to look it up :]. Use, but with comment.''} Participants also found recursive \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman} solutions, which they found noteworthy. For what should have been an iterative \codevar{iterPower} function, the fact that this recursive solution was considered correct by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{unit-test-based }\DIFdelend autograder was considered an autograder bug by some participants. Using the built-in Python exponentiation operator \codevar{**} was also considered correct by the autograder, even though it subverted the point of the assignment. It was also noted as an autograder bug by some participants who found it.

\DIFadd{A }\DIFaddend second 12-person study \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was designed}\DIFaddend , similar in structure to the forum post study, but focused on measuring the coverage achieved by subjects in a fixed amount of time (15 minutes) when browsing and producing feedback on a large number of student solutions.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{Task}} \DIFaddend The coverage study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend task consisted of a more constrained feedback task.

For each strategy they identified, they were asked to fill in the following fields in the table:
 \begin{itemize} 
\item A code example taken from the solution or stack.
\item The identifier of the solution or stack.
\item A short (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one }\DIFaddend sentence) annotation of what was good or bad about the strategy.
\item Their confidence, on a scale of 1-7, that the strategy frequently occurred in the student solutions.

At the end of the study, subjects were asked to rate their agreement with statements about the usefulness of specific features of both the OverCode and baseline interfaces, and responded to the same interface satisfaction 7-point Likert scale statements used in the first study.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\bf \DIFadd{H3: Feedback coverage}} \DIFaddend Each subject reported on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{five }\DIFaddend most frequent strategies in a set of solutions, by copying both a code example and the identifier of the solution (baseline) or stack (OverCode) that it came from. We define \emph{feedback coverage} as the number of students for which the quoted code is relevant, in the sense that they wrote the same lines of code, ignoring differences in whitespace or variable names. We computed the coverage for each example using the following process:
 \begin{itemize} 
\item Reduce the quoted code down to only the lines referred to in the annotation. Often, the subject's annotation would focus on a specific feature of the quoted code, which sometimes had additional lines that were unrelated to the subject's feedback. For example, comments about iterating over a range function, while also quoting the contents of the for loop. This step meant we would be calculating the coverage of a more general (smaller) set of lines.

\item Find the source stack that the quoted code comes from. This is trivial in the OverCode condition, where the stack ID is included in the subject's post. In the baseline, we used the solution ID included in the subject's post to find the stack that it was merged into by the backend pipeline.

\item Find the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend version of each quoted line. The quoted lines of code may be raw code if they come from the baseline condition. By comparing the quoted code with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend code of its source stack, we found the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend version of each line, with variable names and whitespace normalized.

\item Find the raw solutions that include the set of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cleaned }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend lines, using a map from stacks to raw solutions provided by the backend pipeline.

However, on \codevar{compDeriv}, the problem with the most complex solutions, subjects using OverCode were able to achieve significantly more coverage of student solutions than when using the baseline interface (Mann--Whitney U = 0, n1 = n2 = 4, p< 0.05).

There were only two features to ask about in the baseline interface (in-browser find and viewing raw solutions), which were mixed in with statements about features in the OverCode interface. The OverCode feature of stacking equivalent solutions was found more helpful than the baseline \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend features of in-browser find (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{W=41, Z=2.07, p<0.05, r=0.60}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W=41, Z=2.07, p<0.05, r=0.60$}\DIFaddend ) and viewing raw \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend solutions, comments included (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{W=45, Z=2.87,p<0.005,r=0.83}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$W=45, Z=2.87, p<0.005, r=0.83$}\DIFaddend ).

In addition to logging \codevar{read} events, we also recorded usage of interface features, such as creating rewrite rules and filtering stacks. A common usage strategy was to read through the stacks linearly and mark them as \codevar{read}, starting with the largest reference stack, then rewrite trivial variations in expressions to merge smaller \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{behaviorally-equivalent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{behaviorally equivalent }\DIFaddend stacks into the largest stack. Stack filtering (Figure~\ref{linefilter}) was sometimes used to review solutions that contained a particularly conspicuous line\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend e.g.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend a recursive call to solve \codevar{iterPower} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend or an extremely long expression\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)}\DIFdelend . The filter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{panel }\DIFaddend frequency slider (Figure~\ref{linefilter}a) and the variable legend (Figure~\ref{afterrewrite}b) were scarcely used.

All subjects wrote at least two rewrite rules, often causing stacks to merge that only differed in some trivial way, like reordering operands in multiplication statements\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend e.g.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend \codevar{result = result*base} vs. \codevar{result = base*result}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)}\DIFdelend . Some rewrite rules merged Python expressions that behaved similarly but differed in their verbosity\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend e.g.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend \codevar{for i in range(0, exp)} vs. \codevar{for i in range(exp)}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) - variations that might }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.

\DIFaddend \section{Discussion}

Our three-part evaluation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the OverCode }\DIFaddend backend and user interface demonstrates its usability and usefulness in a realistic teaching scenario. Given that we focused on the first three weeks of an introductory Python programming course, our evaluation is limited to single functions, whose most common solutions were less than ten lines long. Some of these functions were recursive, while most were iterative. Variables were generally limited to booleans, integers, strings, and lists of these basic data types. All solutions had already passed the autograder tests, and study participants still found solutions that suggested \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{student }\DIFaddend misconceptions or knowledge gaps. Future work will address more complex algorithms and data types.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsection{Read coverage}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{Read coverage}
\DIFaddend First, we observed that subjects were able to effectively read less in order to cover more ground (H1, read coverage). This is expected, because in OverCode each read stack represented tens or hundreds of raw solutions, while there was only a 1-to-1 mapping between read solutions and raw solutions in the baseline condition. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode's backend makes it possible to produce a single cleaned piece of code that represents }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The OverCode backend produces platonic solutions that represent }\DIFaddend many raw solutions, reducing the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normally high }\DIFdelend cognitive load of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mentally }\DIFaddend processing all the raw solutions, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{including }\DIFaddend their variation in formatting and variable naming.

Figure \ref{readCoverage}(a) shows that in some cases, subjects were able to read nearly as many (\codevar{hangman}) or more (\codevar{iterPower}) function definitions in the baseline as in OverCode. In the case of \codevar{iterPower}, the raw solutions are repetitive because of the simplicity of the problem and the relatively small amounts of variation demonstrated by student solutions. This can explain the subjects' ability to move quickly through the set of solutions, reading as many as 90 solutions in 15 minutes.

Figure \ref{readCoverage}(b) shows the effective number of raw solutions read, when accounting for the number of solutions represented by each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stack }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solution read }\DIFaddend in the OverCode condition. In the case of \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \codevar%%%
\DIFdel{(iterPower)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \codevar{iterPower}\DIFaddend , subjects can say they have effectively read more than 30\% of student solutions after reading the first stack. A similar statement can be made for \codevar{hangman}, where the largest stack \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{represents }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{includes }\DIFaddend roughly 10\% of solutions. In the case of \codevar{compDeriv}, the small size of its largest stack (22 out of 1433 raw solutions) means that the curve is less steep, but the use of rewrite rules (avg. 4.5 rules written per \codevar{compDeriv} subject) enabled subjects to cover over 10x the solutions covered by subjects in the baseline condition.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsection{Feedback coverage}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{Feedback coverage}
\DIFaddend We also found that subjects' feedback on solutions for the \codevar{compDeriv} problem had significantly higher coverage when produced using OverCode than with the baseline, but that this was not the case for the \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman} problems. \codevar{compDeriv} was a significantly more complicated problem than both \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman}, meaning that there was a greater amount of variation between student solutions. This high variation meant that any one piece of feedback might not be relevant to many raw solutions, unless it was produced after viewing the solution space as stacks and creating rewrite rules to simplify the space into larger, more representative stacks. Conversely, the simple nature of \codevar{iterPower} and \codevar{hangman} meant that there was less variation in student solutions. Therefore, regardless of whether the subject was using the OverCode or baseline condition, there was a higher likelihood that they would stumble across a solution that had frequently occurring lines of code, and the feedback coverage for these problems became comparable between the two problems.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsection{Perceived coverage}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{Perceived coverage}
\DIFaddend In addition to the actual read and feedback coverage that subjects achieved, an important finding was that (i) subjects felt they had developed a better high-level understanding of student solutions and (ii) subjects stated they were more confident that identified strategies were frequent issues in the dataset. While a low self-reported confidence score did not necessarily correlate with low feedback coverage, these results suggest that OverCode enables the teacher to gauge the impact that their feedback will have.

\section{GroverCode: OverCode for Grading}\label{sec:grover}

\DIFadd{While understanding the contents of thousands of correct student solutions can be helpful in both residential and online contexts, another application of the OverCode pipeline and interface is supporting the hand-grading of introductory Python programming exam solutions, only some of which are correct. Incorrect solutions are defined as those that do not pass at least one test case in }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OverCode pipeline has been modified in several ways.
It has been split into two phases: solution preprocessing and batch processing. During preprocessing, each solution's formatting is standardized and all comments are removed.
It is then executed on one or more test cases, which makes the resulting canonicalization more robust to any individual poorly chosen test case.
The full program trace and output is recorded for every test case. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{teacher-designed test suite.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This logging of solution execution can be one of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Hand-reviewing solutions is necessary because test suites can unfairly penalize some students and award undeserved credit to others. For example, a single typo in an otherwise well-written solution can cause it to fail all the test cases and receive no credit. Conversely, a solution that subverts the purpose of the assignment can still receive credit by returning the expected answer to some or all of the test cases.
}

\DIFadd{For the staff of 6.0001, the residential introductory Python programming course at MIT, this can be one of the most time-consuming and exhausting parts of teaching the course. It can take a full workday for the entire staff of eight to ten teachers to sit in a room and review several hundred student solutions by hand in order to assign a single numerical grade to each solution.
}

\DIFadd{Stacey Terman, in partial fulfilment of her Master's of Engineering, worked with me to extend OverCode to a new domain, i.e., incorrect solutions, and a new task, i.e., grading hundreds of incorrect solutions by hand. This new version of OverCode for grading is referred to as GroverCode. GroverCode was iteratively designed and evaluated as a grading tool through two live deployments during the Spring 2016 6.0001 staff exam grading sessions. The following tables, figures, and code samples generated from those deployments are adapted with permission from Stacey Terman's thesis.
}

\DIFadd{GroverCode contains two main technical contributions: a modified pipeline that can normalize both correct and incorrect solutions and an interface designed for grading. Just as the original pipeline used variable behavior to normalize variable names, the modified pipeline uses variable behavior and the syntax of statements containing each variable to normalize variable names in solutions that are not correct. This comes from the insight that a variable in an incorrect solution can be semantically equivalent to a variable in a correct solution but still behave differently. It can behave differently due to a bug in a line of code that directly modifies its value or a bug in a line of code that affects the behavior of another variable that it depends on. Since many of the exam solutions are incorrect and do not get clustered together, }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{longer steps in the OverCode analysis pipeline, so preprocessing occurs once were solution and is saved in its own pickle file. New solutionscan be preprocessed once, without affecting previously preprocessed solutions.
Batch processing takes, as input, all the existing preprocessed results and canonializes variable names. This must occur as a batch operation because variable renaming depends on the behaviorand name of every variable in every solution }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{new user interface organizes solutions according to their behavior on test cases and compositional similarity to each other, rather than by cluster size.
}

\subsubsection{User Interface}

\DIFadd{The GroverCode interface, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:whole_interface}, has several additions and distinctions from the OverCode interface. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:correct_and_incorrect_stacks}, both correct solutions and incorrect solutions are displayed, differentiable by their varied background colors and red X's next to every failed test}\DIFaddend . \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To better explain each test failure, the solution's differing actual and expected outputs are also displayed.

\DIFadd{The panel of progress indicators and filters, shown on the left side of Figure~\ref{fig:whole_interface}, helps teachers understand the distribution of solution behavior on test cases, track their grading progress, and grade sets of solutions that fail the same test cases one at a time. The rows of aligned sequences of green checks and red dashes represent error vectors, i.e., the pass/fail results with respect to the ordered list of teacher-specified test cases. The checkbox next to each error vector allows the teacher to selectively view subsets of solutions based on the particular tests they pass and fail. Solutions with the same error vectors may include similar mistakes. 
}

\DIFadd{Like OverCode, GroverCode groups correct solutions into stacks. Grades are propagated to all the solutions in a stack. Incorrect solutions were not also grouped into stacks because the stacking process was new and experimental for field deployment in an actual grading session. GroverCode still normalized all solutions, both correct and incorrect.
}

\DIFadd{The grading performed by the 6.0001 staff was intellectually demanding. For example, many staff members attempted to correct incorrect solutions by hand to better undertstand how far off the student was from a correct answer. When raw solutions are shown in random order, one solution may have a different approach, behavior, and appearance from the next. The transition from grading one solution to the next can mean starting from scratch. In an attempt to minimize the cognitive load of switching from one solution to the next, the GroverCode user interface includes the following features:
} \begin{itemize} 
\item \DIFadd{Horizontally aligned solutions for side-by-side comparison
}\item \DIFadd{Easy filtering of solutions by input-output behavior, i.e., their error vectors
}\item \DIFadd{Normalized variable names
}\item \DIFadd{Solutions ordered to minimize the distance between adjacent solutions with respect to a custom similarity metric defined in Stacey Terman's Master's of Engineering thesis~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{staceythesis}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\item \DIFadd{Highlighted lines of code in each solution which differ from the previous solution in the horizontal list
} \end{itemize} 

\DIFadd{In OverCode, }\DIFaddend a single-line difference between two solutions could, by affecting a variable's behavior, cause the variable renaming process to propagate that difference as a variable name change throughout all the lines that mention the affected variable. This non-locality of difference made it harder to spot in the user interface where the actual syntactic difference between two \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic }\DIFaddend solutions was. As a result, stacks are rendered in the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GroverCode }\DIFaddend user interface slightly differently. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Now, even if the canonicalized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Even if the normalized }\DIFaddend variable names are different between two syntactically identical lines of code in two different stacks, if the variables take on the same sequence of values {\it just within that line of code}, it will not be highlighted as different in the user interface. Only the line with the syntactic difference will be highlighted.


\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In order to implement this , the modified }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{Implementation}\DIFadd{~}\label{subsec:grovercodepipeline}

\DIFadd{The GroverCode implementation is a modification of the OverCode pipeline. Solutions which return an expected output for all test cases during the preprocessing step are categorized as correct, and all other solutions, having failed at least one test case, are categorized as incorrect. Correct solutions are normalized by the same process as was used in the original OverCode. 
}

\DIFadd{In the original OverCode pipeline for correct solutions, variable behavior is assumed to hold enough semantic information to be the sole basis on which variable names are normalized. GroverCode applies this rule to incorrect solutions as well, but only for variables whose behavior matches a common variable in the correct solutions. This step may be error prone. Incorrect solutions are known to be wrong with respect to input-output behavior, the behavior of the variables within them is suspect too, even if it happens to match a common variable in a correct solution. %DIF > if a variable in an incorrect solution has the same behavior as a common variable in the correct solutions, GroverCode will rename the variable in the incorrect solution so it matches the common variable's name in the correct solutions.
}

%DIF > However, this renaming strategy may change in future versions of GroverCode because, 

\DIFadd{In incorrect solutions, syntax, e.g., the operations applied to a variable, may be more helpful for normalizing variable names than behavior. For example, in an incorrect solution, a variable $i$ may be operated or depended on exactly the same way as a common variable in a correct solution. However, if an error somewhere else in the solution causes $i$ to behave differently, the original method of identifying common variables will be thrown off. %DIF > Based on this example, variables in incorrect solutions that are not already renamed based on behavior are renamed based on syntax.
}

\DIFadd{The OverCode pipeline is modified for GroverCode to capture this syntactic information. The modified }\DIFaddend pipeline examines the program trace collected during preprocessing and the AST for each solution and compiles the following information for each line of code in each solution:
 \begin{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Field Deployment}

\DIFadd{Approximately two hundred students were enrolled in 6.0001, and nine instructors used GroverCode to grade nearly all student solutions. %DIF > Seven programming problems of a variety of difficulties were graded over the course of these two sessions.
The GroverCode analysis pipeline was run on both the midterm and final exam problems from the Spring 2016 semester of 6.0001, which had approximately 200 students enrolled. These exams contained seven programming problems in total, and between 133 and 189 solutions per problem made it through the analysis pipeline to be displayed in the user interface. The midterm problem prompts were:
} \begin{itemize} 
\item \texttt{\DIFadd{power}} \DIFadd{(q4): Write a recursive function to calculate the exponential }\texttt{\DIFadd{base}} \DIFadd{to the power }\texttt{\DIFadd{exp}}\DIFadd{.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{give\_and\_take}} \DIFadd{(q5): Given a dictionary }\texttt{\DIFadd{d}} \DIFadd{and a list }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, return a new dictionary that contains the keys of }\texttt{\DIFadd{d}}\DIFadd{. Map each key to its value in }\texttt{\DIFadd{d}} \DIFadd{plus one if the key is contained in }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, and its value in d minus one if the key is not contained in }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{closest\_power}} \DIFadd{(q6): Given an integer base and a target integer }\texttt{\DIFadd{num}}\DIFadd{, find the integer exponent that minimizes the difference between }\texttt{\DIFadd{num}} \DIFadd{and }\texttt{\DIFadd{base}} \DIFadd{to the power of exponent, choosing the smaller exponent in the case of a tie.
} \end{itemize} 
\DIFadd{The final problem prompts were:
} \begin{itemize} 
\item \texttt{\DIFadd{deep\_reverse}} \DIFadd{(q4): Write a function that takes a list of lists of integers }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, and reverses }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}} \DIFadd{and each element of }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}} \DIFadd{in place.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{applyF\_filterG}} \DIFadd{(q5): Write a function that takes three arguments: a list of integers }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, a function }\texttt{\DIFadd{f}} \DIFadd{that takes an integer and returns an integer, and a function }\texttt{\DIFadd{g}} \DIFadd{that takes an integer and returns a boolean.

Instead, they are rendered in the interface as numerical subscripts indicating whether they are the second or third or fourth (etc.

Return the largest element of the mutated list, or -1 if the list is empty after mutation.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{MITCampus}} \DIFadd{(q6): Given the definitions of two classes: }\texttt{\DIFadd{Location}}\DIFadd{, which represents a two-dimensional coordinate point, and }\texttt{\DIFadd{Campus}}\DIFadd{, which represents a college campus centered at a particular }\texttt{\DIFadd{Location}}\DIFadd{, fill in several methods in the }\texttt{\DIFadd{MITCampus}} \DIFadd{class, a subclass of }\texttt{\DIFadd{Campus}} \DIFadd{that represents a college campus with tents at various }\texttt{\DIFadd{Locations}}\DIFadd{.
}\item \texttt{\DIFadd{longest\_run}} \DIFadd{(q7): Write a function that takes a list of integers }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, finds the longest run of either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing integers in }\texttt{\DIFadd{L}}\DIFadd{, and returns the sum of this run.

\subsubsection{Discussion}

\DIFadd{GroverCode was particularly appreciated on simpler problems where correct solutions were clustered together and graded by a single action. Under these conditions, the clustering capability GroverCode inherits from OverCode amplified teacher effort.
}

\DIFadd{Variable renaming was, for simpler programming problems, an invisible and possibly slightly confusing helping hand. One grader remarked, out loud: ``Why is everyone naming their iterator variable `i'?'' at which point he had to be reminded of the variable renaming process. 
}

\DIFadd{When applied to more complex solutions, the normalization process was at times more harmful than helpful for teacher comprehension. As solutions became more varied and structurally complex, graders started toggling off normalization because the renaming of variables, removal of comments, and formatting standardization was removing clues they needed in order to understand student intent.
}

\DIFadd{The feature for grouping solutions based on their behavior on test cases was appreciated regardless of solution complexity. While it was difficult to get direct feedback on the helpfulness of pair-wise difference highlighting and optimized solution ordering, graders heavily used and appreciated the ability to filter and grade solutions one error vector at a time. At least one grader remarked aloud that it seemed like many of the solution with the same error vector made similar mistakes. Therefore filtering by error vector may have been one of the stronger contributors to any hypothetical decreased cognitive load due to using GroverCode over the status quo of random assignment to solutions in a CSV file.

\section{Conclusion}
\DIFadd{OverCode is a novel }\DIFaddend system for visualizing thousands of Python programming solutions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to help }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that helps }\DIFaddend teachers explore the variations among them. Unlike previous approaches, OverCode uses a lightweight static and dynamic analysis to generate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{platonic solutions that represent }\DIFaddend stacks of similar solutions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and uses variable renaming to present cleaned solutions for each stack }\DIFdelend in an interactive user interface. It allows teachers to filter stacks by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{line occurrence }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized lines of code }\DIFaddend and to further merge different stacks by composing rewrite rules. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Based on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As observed in }\DIFaddend two user studies with \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a total of }\DIFaddend 24 current and potential teaching assistants, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we found }\DIFdelend OverCode allowed teachers to more quickly develop a high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions, and provide feedback that is relevant to more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{students' solutions.
